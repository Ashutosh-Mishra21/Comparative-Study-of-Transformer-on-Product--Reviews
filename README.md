# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Healthcare Product Reviews

## üìñ Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon healthcare product reviews using both traditional lexicon-based and modern transformer-based NLP models.

## üì¶ Dataset
- **Source**: Amazon 2023 Health & Personal Care Product Reviews
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Cleaning text (remove emojis, special patterns)
  - Handling short reviews
  - Balancing classes

## ü§ñ Models Used
- **VADER** (Lexicon-Based)
- **RoBERTa** (Transformer-Based)
- **DistilBERT**
- **Twitter RoBERTa**
- **XLNet**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hybrid Approach
A weighted combination of VADER and RoBERTa scores:
\[
S_{\text{hybrid}} = \alpha \times S_{\text{VADER}} + (1-\alpha) \times S_{\text{RoBERTa}}
]\

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
- Cohen‚Äôs Kappa

## üìä Statistical Comparison
- Chi-square test showed significant differences between RoBERTa and Twitter RoBERTa ($p < 0.001$).

## üìö Conclusion
- Transformer-based models significantly outperform lexicon-based models.
- Hybrid approach improves robustness and interpretability.
