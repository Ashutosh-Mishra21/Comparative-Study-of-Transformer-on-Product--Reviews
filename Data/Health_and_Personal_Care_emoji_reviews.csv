98,5.0,top notch earplugs for swim/ shower!!,"These are pool/shower quality ear plugs! I have bad swimmers ear, even in the shower 🚿, these come with the coolest metal keychain worthy container and a great lite neckstrap to hook up your earplugs , place the plugs in your ears and shower or swim 🏊‍♂️.. then just hang them up to dry out!",98

366,4.0,Pretty Patterns but the Edges Aren’t Perfectly Smooth on This One,"I do love the color variations present throughout this carved piece of natural jade, but it does have an uneven notch/blemish present along the longest edge that obviously resulted from a tool mark mistakenly made during the grinding process. This scraper does have an unshiny, matte finish (it is not super glossy like some other gua sha tools I’ve used), so it might be more preferred by those searching for a natural looking accessory, and it seems comfortably sized and shaped overall.<br /><br />It does come with an attractive drawstring storage bag with a leafy botanical design, so that is a nice bonus, I just wish every edge of this scraper had been smoothly shaped and polished. But that’s the only critique I have for this one. It’s great for increasing circulation and lymphatic drainage and for increasing the absorption of various face serums! I’d gladly recommend this jade tool to others. 🌿",366
369,5.0,Sip Sip Hooray! 🍷🌿,"The antioxidant-rich solution contained in these squeeze pouches is packaged and produced in Canada. The directions say it should be stored in a dry, dark place at room temperature, and the flavor tastes like tart grape juice. 🍇 The ingredients do list the presence of a couple of preservative compounds, but I like that there are no artificial flavors or added sugars, and the box comes stamped with a clearly marked expiration date.<br /><br />There are only 10 calories present per serving, but the recommended usage schedule advises consumers to take one sachet twice daily. At $20 per box, it would cost customers $120 a month to consume this resveratrol supplement regularly (because 10 pouches would disappear every 5 days). Since the overall price and perceived value of any item is subjective, the purchase likelihood will vary from person to person, but the potential payoff is exponentially beneficial.<br /><br />If this super fruit solution can combat free radical damage enough to slow or reverse aging, then I’m in! Since it does also contain goji, blueberry, pomegranate, cranberry, açaí, and green tea extracts, I at least feel like I’m consuming a myriad of healthy juices in the process! I’m pleased with the brand and the easy-to-open packaging overall, but I’d probably rather have a single container of the liquid substance rather than multiple single-use pouches. I try to support ♻️ reducing waste however I can, but that’s my only critique of this one!",369
590,5.0,Thick & No Fuzz 😊,"These wipes are nice & thick, they smell good also. An the price is good. I'm going to buy more because I always use wipes. An these are close to Cottonelle & Huggies  wipes. What I really like is that no white fuzz comes off the wipe. Buy these Wipes😊",590

774,5.0,Better for the environment,"These bamboo toothbrushes are nice for the price. This multipack includes both adults and children’s sizes in different color bristles.<br /><br />There is nothing extraordinary about these, however the price is good and they are 💯 biodegradable which is better for the environment.<br /><br />They work just as a toothbrush should. The firmness of the bristles feel medium, not too soft.. yet not too hard.",774

1219,5.0,Relieves congestion without the nasty side effects of OTC drugs,"I prefer the Nasopure System Kit for sinus irrigation because I can control the flow and the nozzle tip forms a better seal with my nostril than traditional ceramic Neti Pots. The buffered salt solution is less likely to cause any irritation and it's pre-measured. Easy peasy, just mix and apply a light squeazy.<br /><br />The Neti pot has been around for hundreds of years, and when used properly it is the safest and most effective remedy to clear my stuffy sinuses and help relieve postnasal drip. I cannot use the over the counter sinus meds because some make me drowsy and others give me palpitations.<br /><br />PLEASE READ:<br /><br />1. The most important RULE to remember, and this is not optional, is to NEVER USE TAP WATER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IF you MUST use tap water let it boil for just over a minute or san and allow it to cool to room temperature before using.  Distilled sterile water is recommended and you can buy it in the grocery store.<br /><br />2. If you are unfamiliar with the proper technique for using a Neti Pot there are many instructional videos on YouTube. This should be a safe and relatively comfortable experience.<br /><br />3. Clean the NetiPot after every use. and let air dry.<br /><br />Please follow ollow the instructions and read recommendations on the FDA's website to ensure safe use and you're good to go.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

1220,5.0,Clean accurate cut,"The pharmacy recently changed my mom's prescription from an easy to break caplet to a rock hard tablet, and we have tested no less than five pill splitters to cut her meds into a precise dosage. I kid you not, this is the very first time I have successfully split an aspirin sized pill into an exact half. I think the problem with many pill cutters is the plastic blade guard. This one does not have one, so the cut is clean. No more crumbs and two-third cuts. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **",1220

1222,4.0,"Vesitile, adjustable, and soothing support for hip and sacroiliac pain","I am truly impressed with the Sui Song, Sacroiliac Support Belt because it is is one of the most versatile and adjustable support braces I have tried. Over the years, I have had many sports injuries and the issues that occur naturally with age. This belt can be used for comforting support of any number of areas from the lower back, sciatic nerve to hip injuries, including the sacroiliac, which is a very difficult area to support.  The velcro is covered with a protective fleece strip, so be sure to remove it, or you will think it's the worst Velcro ever. LOL. Yes, it took me a minute to discover that because most manufacturers don't bother to protect the Velcro. The overall quality is excellent, and this belt can be adjusted to find the sweet spot of soothing relief. With all of my injuries, I would consider myself the queen of pain, and this is one of the best support belts I have found so far, There is nothing else like it, and I highly recommend it for those difficult to treat areas. Now, if I could only find something this good for my shoulder, I would be in heaven!<br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

I was hoping the pages of this nicely bound hardcover journal would have a smoother and softer feel, but it is more like sketchbook or book paper with a rough and scratchy feel. It's just okay, but not my favorite.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **",1224

1975,4.0,Allergy Test,"This is just one of MANY at-home tests out there.<br /><br />I actually have experience with a similar test – my mom’s A1c test that is sent every few months. In fact, she got one just a few days before I posted this review.<br /><br />This works IDENTICAL to that one.<br /><br />Each has:<br /><br />✉️ Pre-paid mailer to send back<br />💉 Lancets (at least 3)<br />🧼 Alcohol Prep Pad<br />🩸Card for blood droplets<br />📃 Instructions<br />☣️ Bio-Hazard bag for sample card<br />🩹 Band-aid(s) for after<br /><br />The idea is simple – prep the card (with the sticker and fill out info), wash hands, prick fingers, droplets on card, wait until it dries, package it up, mail within a certain amount of time.<br /><br />As for the accuracy …<br /><br />My mom’s A1c was pretty accurate when done this way.<br /><br />This allergy test? I was a bit surprised by the results – no to nuts, which I thought I had an issue with. Turns out – maybe not. Goat cheese (feta) – no allergy there. STRONG reaction to goat’s milk. That’s interesting, but I wouldn’t doubt it.<br /><br />The cost? Under $150, probably comparable to a lab if you don’t have insurance.<br /><br />It is from a certified lab and the results are viewed by a physician. I wouldn’t use it to self-treat, but it isn’t bad to know what’s going on.",1975

These ear plugs are very comfortable and I believe they will work just fine. I got the small size and I like how they will not be visible given their clear to opaque color.

My Hines isn’t as tiny as his, 🙄, so my reaction was different when I sat on it. No one spot on your gluts has pressure, it’s spread over the cushion. He really likes it, me too!

17643,5.0,Great serum/ampoule for post inflammatory hyperpigmentation,"This beautiful golden ampoule comes in a heavy glass bottle with a dropper. Very hygienic and easy to use. It has a slightly viscous texture. The first thing I noticed when I used it is a burst of refreshing 🍊 fragrance upon application. It smells delicious but dissipate very fast. A whole drop Full is enough product for face and neck. The serum/ampoule spread easily with decent slip and absorbed readily, leaving my face with just a tiny bit of tackiness.<br />.<br />I have been using this for about 3-4 nights a week for about 1 month now. During testing time, I did not have any irritation or adverse reactions. I do noticed an overall brightening/lightening effects on my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation spots. However, I cannot definitively say this is the result of this product alone because I have a lot of other skincare products in my routine. But I do recommend this ampoule because it is a high quality product. It will surely help if your goal is to achieve skin brightening, following acne/breakouts episodes.",17643

17954,5.0,Super Convenient,"Well made, quality mask strap/lanyard. Better than all the other cheap “shoe-lace” style straps out there. Definitely prefer this thin, stretchy, black leather over the cold feeling chains (in cold weather) that could possibly catch with my hair or neck vellus hairs. I have a chain and bead style which both look like necklaces and I like them but I find myself prefering this. The men in my family also prefer this style. (However would be even better if the lobster clasp could also be offered in silver, carbon or black instead of gold.)<br /><br />So convenient to take on and off in the car before entering a store or after. No more misplaced masks in purses or pockets. Just hang and go. 👌",17954

18933,5.0,Very pleased with results of COVE sessions !,"I have been using my COVE unit for two weeks, and I am extremely impressed with the results I have received !  As expected,  I have been able to fall asleep within about 15 minutes after use, and my quality of sleep has been consistently calm and uninterrupted by any stressful impulses.<br /><br />In addition, I am most impressed with the relief of the aches and pains I had been experiencing in my joints and muscles.  Not only have I been under a lot of stress due to COVID, but I have some pending personal issues that are stressful,  not in my control,  and won’t be resolved for many months.  Since beginning my COVE sessions, I firmly believe that the relief from the aches and pains is a result of the stress relief I am experiencing after using the COVE.  I was primarily feeling joint and muscle aches in my arms and legs … I have had none since starting COVE sessions.<br /><br />I will continue to use my COVE three times a day and anticipate that I will continue to achieve relief from stress.  There are so many positive results I hope to continue to experience, from relief from fitful sleep, negative thinking, depression, nerve and muscle pain, to immobilization and anxiety.  The COVE is proving to be extremely beneficial in the reduction of stress.  Stress can be deadly, so I welcome how the COVE is giving me significant stress relief 😮‍💨<br /><br />In gratitude,<br />Sharon Simon",18933

It's also cuddle enough  to do a few short sprays around the house just before companies arrive, They will think you have a candle lit somewhere. It's perfect. and I'm not normally fond of Lilacs.

I’m telling you guys because I didn’t realize that could be done!! Made a fantastic difference and if my hand wasn’t wearing out I wouldn’t have needed a new one at all!<br />  Therefore I thought getting new handle would work just as well as replacing the other part did… However it didn’t.and I ended up putting my old handle back on Rather than use this. I think the problem is it’s not an exact  Match to the part it’s replacing !!!<br />  🤷🏻‍♀️ However I can’t be sure if that’s the only reason.<br />I decided to buy a new machine rather than invest in this older one.",23676

24271,5.0,Just what I was hoping for...,I just got an email from the vendor ans realized I hadn't given my review of my cupping set. It is exactly what I wanted! It comes with so many perfect sized cups for use on different areas and I can even use it on myself when I have no other therapist around to work on me. They provide a great suction and  really bring  blood to the areas of stagnation and help to break up adhesions. I'm very happy with the quality as well they are not cheap flimsy plastic and of course you should handle them with care if you want them to stay in good condition. That's just common sense.

And i am down to one after buying 2 sets (total of 4). Following all the instructions, they burst anyway.<br /><br />The hole on to fill it is too small and have been burned with the water sputtering out to displace the air.<br /><br />I bought these because its absolutely insane to spend more than ten bucks on one. But it seems 10 for two was just too good to be decent.<br /><br />I use hotwater bottles because while i HATE being too hot i cannot stand my feet to be cold. I fill them to place on my feet when im in bed so i dont have to wait for my body to heat up which, depending on what i did before getting into bed, could be a few minutes to a few hours where im in a half sleep state trying to warm up.<br /><br />I bought these in, like, September, started using them in regularly and daily the nights in October, and twice a day since November.<br /><br />The first one burst the first day using it the second one developed a hole where the first pne developed a hole further pushing the notion that these are thin where they shouldnt be.<br /><br />The third one burst when i was squeezing out the air to screw om the cap prompting this update, and it was not at all small.<br /><br />If they were made decently, they could withstand the daily use. But thats clearly not the case.<br />I am thoroughly disappointed in these. I wont be buying these again, ill look elsewhere for them.<br /><br />714am Friday the 27th december 2019.<br />Theyre all gone now.

31077,5.0,A Vapers Dream,"I signed into Amazon just to leave this review. I've been using shoestring cotton since I started building my own coils about 2 years ago. With money tight, I wasn't able to order another package before I ran out, so I grabbed this after reading the reviews. I have loose Cotton Bacon & Firebolt Cotton but I HATE trying to twist it to fit through the coils. I always end up with these tiny strings that just don't cut it. I use a thicker juice, so I tend to rewick every other day, if not daily, so I use a couple different RTA's so if I'm tired or busy or just don't feel good, I can keep vaping. I had 1 piece of shoestring cotton left & that went into my Zeus X rip-off (bought on Wish) & THIS cotton in my Real Zeus X & my Dead Rabbit v2 RTA. OH MY GOD! It really was super easy to wick, and it wasn't tiny strands either. And the flavor.... there's barely any break in & what little break in there is, isn't all that bad. Sometimes fresh cotton tastes awful for the first 10-15 puffs. This didn't taste awful at all & the break in was quick. Idk if it's just me, but I feel like my cloud production has also grown with this! Never going back to shoestring cotton again. And the price is phenomenal!! Can't beat it! 💜💙💜💙",31077

32655,5.0,"Fantastic for female comfort under breast area--very gentle, no rash!","My review is not tagged as a ""Verified Purchase"" only because a friend bought the product for me; I assure you however I've been using it for several days and I genuinely love it--especially for maintaining dryness and comfort in the under-breast area, even after exercise. This is important to me because it seems like my skin is becoming more sensitive everyday and hyper-prone to rash--and sweat is a MAJOR culprit.<br /><br />I wouldn't have thought to turn to Gold Bond for this problem; I guess I always associated it with men and--to be honest--feet, haha. I actually tried a cream specifically designed for women first; it didn't work AND gave me a hellish rash. Talcum powder is out these days due to  health issues, and so I was out of ideas.

34430,1.0,"Came apart, fit weird","What’s worse than a crappy pair of gloves?? How about 12 pairs of crappy gloves!!! These seemed like a great deal for the price and I really needed some gloves to wear with hand cream while I sleep because my skin is suuuuper dry this spring. These gloves don’t fit. My hands are average size and the fingers of these gloves are way too short. I feel like I have webbed hands! They are really loose in the wrists and not long enough to cover the severely dry hand area, which extends all the way to the wrist for me. I wore them for one night and woke up with them half off and one was even coming apart already. Not sure if I should return or toss. If you have really round hands and short fingers, maybe these could work for you, but be warned, every box came taped jankily so I would not plan to use these as part of a gift in the boxes they came in 😕 I would have been better off just picking up some gloves at the dollar store.",34430

35271,5.0,💖💖💗💤💤💤NO More Waking Up at Night Constantly💤💤💤💗💞,"As we get older, testosterone, the male hormone, stimulates the prostate cells to grow, multiply and enlarge. The problem is the prostate, a walnut sized,  is located just below the bladder. This is where urine accumulates and then flows through the tube called the urethra. As the prostate enlarges and grows around the urethra, it squeezes the urethra, slowing the flow of urine. Like an hourglass, the urine can only flow through the urethra at a trickle, eventually squeezing it so tight it eventually stops! This causes me to wake up frequently, often 3-5 times a night. This results in me feeling fatigued due to insufficient 💤💤💤 from sleep deprivation caused by BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia).<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I am happy to have discovered 『Prostavol Prostate Support』. Unboxing revealed that it came in a 30-day supply (60 capsules).<br /><br />PROS<br />====<br />💕👍💓 Effective: Decreased my frequency to bathroom in only 2-3 weeks<br />💓👍💕 Easy to swallow: in capsule form, goes down easily<br />💕👍💓 No Side Effects: all-natural ingredients<br /><br />CONS<br />====<br />😒🙄😣 Pricey: $2/dose a bit rough on the wallet<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  Without a doubt, Prostavol is the most advanced formula I've ever come across, and I've tried A LOT of them including prescription needed most commonly taken drug Flomax. Most other prostate health supplements contain only Saw Palmetto with just a few other ingredients. Prostavol uses 33 highly effective ingredients based on the latest research in prostate health. With 300mg of Plant Sterols at 40% Beta-Sitosterol and 200mg of Saw Palmetto, no wonder it’s the most effective when it comes to fighting my enlarged prostate & stopping going to the bathroom seemingly constantly.<br /><br />💞💌💓👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💖💗💗💞💌💌",35271
35272,5.0,❣️💕💞👍 Effective Wax-like Conditioner Restore the Shines On my Leather Shoes👍💞💕❣️,"[[VIDEOID:e79f6c78a08022965c33585842ba73b8]] When I purchase a pair of dress shoes for that upcoming interviews, weddings, etc, the salesman often would ask me if I want to buy some protective creams or solutions. I had purchased some before, they weren't very good, and they weren't cheap either.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Workman's Friend Leather Conditioners』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a square tin jar, with 4oz (118 ml) of all-natural leather conditioner. Once the lid is removed, you can see a lard-like color & wax texture, so you know this, when applied to any leather surface, it will stick & won't run off the shoe contours wasting valuable conditioner. But, how does it work, especially compared to the ones I had bought from shoe sales clerks?<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  In order to better test this new leather conditioners, I dug out one of my older, but still favorite, pair of leather dress shoes which has been neglected since I ran out of any leather protection solution or cream. I took out a cotton ball, and dipped some of this Workman's Friend Leather Conditioner onto my shoes. After only several back and forth wipes on the surface, I can already visibly see shine, as it really gets into the leather to nourish & moisturize the leather, just like I'd put on night serum to better protect my facial skins. Again,due to its lard- and wax-like texture, it really stays on the surface well, and give off that shine, especially compared to my untreated left shoes (see review  video). I even sprayed some mist on both left & right shoes, the treated right shoes protects the surface well, while water mist left shoes wet.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't just work well on shoes, I tried it on my leather messenger bags, leather jackets, belts, this leather Conditioner really help restore the shines, and give second life, and extend it's longevity.<br /><br />❣️💕💕💞👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💞💕❣️",35272
35274,5.0,💓💕💢💢👍 Convenient & Effective Way to Replenish Lost Collagen💪💯💥💗💞,"Collagen supplements help by giving your body amino acids which help replenish the body’s collagen supply.  It’s no mystery that as we age we lose collagen, so by supplementing with Collagen we are able to help repair ligament and tendon injuries (which was my primary interest) as well as helps give you stronger nails, thicker hair improved circulation and wound healing.  The lists of the benefits of Collagen goes on and on.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Neocell Super Collagen Powder』, which comes in a plastic  jar. Inside, you'd see this coffee creamer powder like texture & this particular one was vanilla. The recommended daily use is a scoopful (scoop provided for easy measurement).<br /><br />My main motivation to try this Collagen powder is 1. For my hair & nails - they've been cracking at the tips, 2. For my joint pains: suffering from chronic lower back & knee pains. Through my own research, collagen, provides several benefits as we age:<br /><br /> * Improve Skin Health<br />* Helps Relieve Joint Pain<br />* Could Prevent Bone Loss<br />* Promotes Heart Health<br />* Hair and Nails Health*<br />* Promotes Gut health<br />* Brain Health<br /><br />Trouble is we lose collagen as we age, so taking collagen supplements help replenish the much needed nutrients. Taking this can not be easier, not only it looks like your regular coffee creamer, you can use it like a regular coffee creamer - just add a scoop to your cup of coffee or tea & start reaping the aforementioned health benefits<br /><br />The VERDICT<br /><br />I've been taking for about two weeks, and I see my hair shinier & more importantly for me, my nail fingertips don't crack anymore.<br /><br />😋💓💞💯🔥👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💪👍💪💯💞💕",35274

I never owned &#34;toys&#34; but I decided to buy some to try to spice up the relationship.<br />This Vibrator arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly. It came inside of a cute little box that was totally discreet. Inside the box was the Vibrator, charger, and instructions for use.<br />This Vibrator is made out of hospital grade silicone so it's completely safe to use and has no smell whatsoever. It's also completely silent and waterproof which makes it easy to use in the bath or shower without anyone else knowing. It has 7 different settings so there is definitely one that you are bound to love... Personally, I love them all. My absolute favorite thing about this vibrator is the voice function. You simply press the button to turn on the voice function and it will vibrate in tune with your speaking! The louder you are the faster it vibrates. The lower you speak the slower it vibrates. My fiancé had a alot of fun with it!!<br />This vibrator is perfect for any couple who want to experiment a bit...

I have tried other green powers and I hate that they are sweet and have other junk in them.

36324,4.0,"Not just for blackheads, also for winter dry, dead skin 💁🏻‍♀️","This device easily removes blackheads. The suction is very strong for it's size. I had one before that didn't work nearly as well this one. Make sure you don't leave it in one place for too long or you might end up with a bruise on your face. The different sized tips allow treatment on different areas.<br />The screen lights up and shows suction strength and battery life. It is easy to clean. Just put the tips in some soapy warer. Stands up nicely out of the box.<br />Honestly, they have stepped up their game for these blackheads removers. It's a lot smaller than the old ones. Suction is better. The parts are smaller. They offer free replacement on the tips of the vacuum. All you have to do is follow the directions and register your device.<br />It takes some practice with it. Once you get the hang of it, you will see how much clearer your face looks and feels. I definitely recommend this product. It's simple, and very easy to use. I'm getting my teenager one to have of her own.<br />For people saying “ it’s too strong, left bruises” are probably not using it correctly. When using this device , make sure to keep it moving. If left too long in one spot , of course it’s going to leave a bruise .😵<br />If you wash your face once , twice a day .. you probably will not suck up as many blackheads. You have less oil build up on your face (like me) so I don’t have as many blackheads . My face dries out more than my boyfriends face . It’s better for me to use the Microdermabrasion head. It helps smooth out fine lines, Wrinkles and dead -dried skin that is peeling off. You should add a moisturizer after using this device.<br />This is an awesome little device , when used properly.",36324

39118,5.0,My FAVORITE!!!!,"Oh my stars 🌟 My favorite New hair styling tool!! So fun & easy to use! First, I recommend you Watch the videos & follow instructions so as not to get your hair tangled! Once you understand that you only use one side of the barrel and begin using this, you will love it too!!! If you have long hair like me, you need to understand that it cannot curl a strand all the way to your scalp unless you are using a very tiny amount at a time. Works best for you if you curl bottom 2/3 of hair length.<br />Beautiful results once mastered. It took me only once around my head (with long hair) to master it! Simple & fun to use! I’ve actually shared this with my friends who have also bought one too!! 🥰",39118

39970,5.0,Awesome dog nail trimming tools!,"This product was definitely easy to use and is great quality. The nail cutters have a good feel and handle even though it wasn’t my first time cutting my dogs nails. It was, however, my first time using a the nail grinder which was also easy to use. As it was grinding down though, it did smell funny just because you’re literally grinding the nail down but it wasn’t scary or intimidating while using it. Overall, I recommend the product. 😁",39970
40033,2.0,Poor Rechargeable Battery,It was working okay till it just started running out of battery within the day after a month of purchase 😞,40033
40065,1.0,Got a Used Product,So I'm happy with the product. Unfortunately I didn't begin to use right away and the return window closed before I realized that one of them was already used 😢<br />If someone reaches out to me to replace the used item I will change my review 🤷‍♀️,40065

40263,5.0,It Works!,[[VIDEOID:fba00a401ea957272a48b8762ab58d35]] I like it. The scrubber isn't that soft like somebody said it was. Its more like average speed not too soft and not really hard. I usually scrub my body with this lvl of speed. In fact it might even be faster then my hand speed. The only diffrence now is I don't need to move too much my arms. If your expecting a hard scrub like to the point your skin gets all red this isn't it for you. This is like spa treatment. And it does clean you well. If it doesn't you need a better soap 😂 because this brush is good. It also has 3speeds in case I didn't mentioned that already.<br /><br />Vivian S.,40263
40301,5.0,WOW! Fast Results with NO Sensitivity. Love it,"I am quite the coffee drinker so my teeth have definitely yellowed over the past year. I heard about trying charcoal to naturally whiten teeth so purely based on customer reviews I chose this one, I am glad I did. The first picture was day 1, second was day 4. Another reason I chose this route was because I could no longer handle crest white strips, my gums and teeth were aching horribly. This product, I felt no pain whatsoever, zero problems and the taste is not awful either... a little salt yet earthy (if that makes sense). I strongly recommend this. Super simple, yes it's messy when you spit but it's nothing a quick rinse of water can't fix. 😆",40301
40340,5.0,Soooo goood,Smells soooooo gooood I am lovin livin it 😀,40340
40359,5.0,Love it.,"In love with this beauty, So I have the craziest super straight lashes, they always fall down specially after applying mascara, that’s why whem I saw this I got so happy, cause is made so you can curl your lashes after applying mascara, I once ripped off my lashes for curling them with a regular lash curler, So I was so scared until I saw this, very easy to use, it gets very hot but won’t burn your skin, the light gets green when you turn it on, and the red dot 🔴 on the back goes completely clear when the lash is ready to use, I love this a lot.",40359
40371,1.0,Not what I expected or described 😔,"[[VIDEOID:ba6c18639ab46c73877de0c6971ad751]] The toys are cute and it's a lot but also almost half of the toys are broken and there were no stretch frog, parachute man, disguise glasses, toy skate boards at all not a one. Most of the toys worthless and broken 🤷🏽 This is for my son's birthday pinata I went to Walmart to buy more toys.",40371
40552,5.0,Does the job well!,"The bottle arrived quickly and safely. The ingredients seem to be a good mix to give me the boost I need. They’re also made clean in and FDA Registered and GMP Certified Facility in the USA.<br />  I like taking a scoop of something and being done but, these are easily portable to just bring the 8 Capsules Per Serving, which is what’s called for, in your pocket, which is what I did.😁 I’d recommend!",40552
40555,4.0,Pretty Good!,"I’ve been using Creatinine from its inception, when it was Crazy expensive and the next best thing since sliced bread, so to speak.😁 I know it’s helped me but, I don’t think I’ve had one that actually has 7 different forms of it as this does. It’s too knew to state any serious differences but, I can say that I do feel energy from it and I definitely tastes better than plain Creatine.<br />  It also includes what they call a “Rapid Cell Drive Matrix”, that looks to have some great ingredients that help the blood flow to the muscles and to be absorbed better. I’m happy I tried it.<br />  The only thing I would change is for their Testing and Manufacturing Practices to be listed so I can know all I can about what I’m taking.",40555
40561,4.0,It’s so helpful!,"These are made Gluten, Chemical and Hormone-Free and all Non-GMO. The goats are all Grass-Fed so, with all of those positive things, I feel like I’m taking a healthy product. The bottle also comes with 30 Servings in it; each Serving is 4 Capsules and you can take up to 8 Per Day, especially if you’re working out hard.<br />  I’ve been taking it off and on for many years (over a decade)and all I can say is that the older I get, I definitely start notice if I ran out and stopped taking it for a while. It definitely helps my stomach and it’s also good at keeping my Immune System in check. I’d recommend checking it out, especially if you’ve chronic stomach issues like me.🙂<br />  Cons: I think it’s a fine product, as I’ve been happy with others from them but, I’d like it if they posted their Manufacturing and Testing processes. I like to be able to quickly know instead of having to search around. It’s also pretty pricey but, unless you buy in bulk, that’s often the reality of quality Colostrum.",40561
40562,5.0,Good stuff!,"This Sam-e is made nice and clean, is GMP Certified and is made in the USA. It has helped me with the pain in my joints and the stress in dealing with the pain that comes from it. I can also speak for the stink concern of another review I saw. It simply is a naturally smelly supplement, as quite a few supplements I know of are.<br />  I actually have another very good brand of Sam-e that I’m currently not finished with and it definitely isn’t an enjoyable smell but, I could care less because of how it helps me.😁 Anyway, I would definitely recommend it. Oh, this one is also great because, it’s 500mg with 1 capsule and the other I have needs 2 caps to get 500mg. Nice!",40562
40563,4.0,Great way to wake up!,"This stuff definitely has some fine ingredients to help get some of my morning fog and sloth out of my way.😁 It’s as advertised too, because it definitely has quite a few of things I often take separately and they in this and mostly with respectable amounts to replace them. It’s Caffeine-Free but, these things really help me get going and my brain to process well.<br />  I’m definitely a fan of it now and would recommend it.<br />  Cons: Only one thing: It’s made in the USA and they say it’s GMP Certified in their advertising, which is important to me and a good thing but, it doesn’t say anything about it on the bottle and it should, especially so I wouldn’t have had to search all over for it.",40563
40565,4.0,Tasty Power!,"It has a super boost of power and I like the taste. It has Creatine and other goodies for building up the muscles so, it’s good to pull out the scoop and shake the jar a bit before scooping it to make sure it’s mixed well. I pull the scoop first to avoid having to dig for it.😁<br />  I like the scary name too. Lol! Whether you use a double dose of 400mg of Caffeine or a half dose, I would recommend it.",40565
40567,5.0,Love them!,"These are made with a fantastic mix of healthy ingredients to help to keep the Immune System in great order and impressive ingredients, including Alpha-GPC for my brain and lots of other great things. The bottle is a 30 day supply by taking 3 Capsules Per Day. These are great for the Aging Process too.<br />  What tops all of that off is that they’re made really clean in an GMP Certified in an FDA Registered Facility in the USA then, they’re even 3rd Party Tested for their Purity and Potency.<br />  I would definitely recommend them.<br />  Enjoy!😁",40567
40569,5.0,Tren is Awesome!,"I’ve watched friends grow and grow as I was plateaued because, they were using Trenorol and Testosterone Supplements. Even without the Testosterone, they were growing but, they definitely work well together. When I had finally tried it, it drove me nuts at how much it helped and all of the growth my friends had gotten when I was actually hammering in the gym more than them. Haha!<br />  I can’t hammer in the gym right now but, it’s felt great exercising at home and actually feeling some positive gain again. It’s not a Steroid and as long as you flush your Liver and Kidneys afterwards and you boost your Testosterone after your cycle, I think Tren is a safe and fantastic supplement to help you push past plateaus.<br />  Be Safe and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40569
40570,4.0,Lots of Energy!,"This is a great energy booster for a good Workout. I inadvertently took it too late last night and slept terribly. I figured it out late into the night. Haha!<br />  Get your blood flowing and boost your Energy and Focus. This has all Natural Flavors,Sweeteners and is good for Vegans too. I’m still waiting for Tattle to post their Testing and Manufacturing processes but, I have to say I enjoy their products and hope they add that information in the near future.<br />  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40570
40571,5.0,I’m loving the Pickleball!,"Hydration is so important and the average person doesn’t get it. The healthiest people end up seriously ill and it’s often caused by something as simple as being dehydrated. This deal is great and it comes with 60 Sachets of Orange-Flavored Hydration that tastes great and does the job well.<br />  I love these things and would definitely recommend this stuff in any form they have but, these Sachets are so convenient.<br />  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40571
40572,4.0,Fantastic ingredients!,"I’d swear by the ingredients in this and these are even from Grass-fed Bovine in New Zealand. If you have any pain issues due to joints and bones being damaged, I’d recommend this all day long and if you don’t, I’d recommend this all day long.😁 It’s just a wonderful product to help keep the body working well and think it’s great for everyone.<br />  This one doesn’t say they Are GMP Certified but, it states online that that adhere to those standards. I couldn’t find anything about that on the bottle or anywhere in the pages for the Terraflora Probiotics they make and I hope they show this on the bottles in the future because, I really like to know all I can about my intake and hope to find the information easily because, there’s lots of competition in supplements.",40572
40573,5.0,Healthy Green Goodness!,"This ones easy if you’re a fan of Wheatgrass Shots. A shot of it in an establishment can cost a few bucks and this bag is currently $34.99 and has enough for 266 Shots inside; Deal! I think it’s also a comparable price in general too.<br />  It’s a taste that I just had to remember that it’s good for me so, I like it now. I just add it into my concoction of other healthy supplements like this throughout the day for some healthy and natural energy. I would definitely recommend it because of everything I said and because it’s also USDA Organic.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40573
40574,5.0,It’s like New!,"I tested it on an old Bread Knife I have that is still sharp but, I figured the handle was rotten. I took a before and after set of pictures to show that this stuff did a really nice job in essentially renewing it. The pictures are about an hour apart because, I wanted to make sure it was dry and wouldn’t look bad after it dried; it dried well because of the Bees Wax and a few other kitchen safe ingredients.<br />  I would definitely recommend it!<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40574
40575,4.0,Beta Glucan is Fantastic!,"I see in their advertising that they say it’s The Most Powerful All-Around Supplement and it’s arguably right around the top, at least in my view. It’s a simple couple of ingredients to bring such a strong Immune System boost that makes it so great. I think it’s a wonderful supplement to have around, essential these days and I’d recommend it to everyone.<br />  Cons: It seems that this is a good product and the company seems to have an extensive amount of happy customers to go by so, I’m happy too. My only issue is something I hold Every Supplement Company up to and that’s them sharing their information on their testing practices for Purity, Quality and Quantity; they show nothing. I know it’s made in the USA, which is a “general” plus for the safety of supplements but, I like to see information I can actually confirm if I decided to.<br />  Hopefully they do in the future because, they do seem to be pretty decent.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40575
40576,4.0,Taste good!,"I believe it’s an absolute fact that the well beyond the average person does Not get enough of the protein there body needs in the average day, especially if you’re a Vegan. Supplements like this Plant Based Protein are so important. I do think this one is a bit pricey though.<br />  It’s made free of GMO’s, Soy , Gluten, etc. I see that they don’t have any information about their testing processes for Purity, Quantity, Potency, etc, but they do offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee. I’m really picky on wanting all of the information I can about the quality of a product I’m taking.<br />  I figure that this company is relatively new because of using bags instead of containers. I always like to see new companies make a success of themselves and hopefully they share more information in the future because, there’s a great deal of competition they’re up against. I would support them.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40576
40577,5.0,Good Stuff!,I’ve been eating Cliff Bars for decades and I’ve never seen tiny ones like these. It’s perfect to actually have 65mg of Caffeine in each one and call it Espresso. They are a little chunk of Espresso goodness and I would highly recommend them.  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁,40577
40578,4.0,Not bad!,"I don’t know much about this company but, the Dark Chocolate tastes good. It seems to be made out of good and clean Whey Isolate, which is the best to me.<br />  I don’t understand why the advertising would specifically say this is for Women. I don’t see anything that’s specific for women, as is the case with many things. It’s a huge mass of business being not being included. Also, I would love to see  information about its testing for purity.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40578
40579,5.0,Perfect for it’s purpose!,"What I mean by that is that if you’re just looking for protein to simply have protein, then I would consider this too pricey and I’d just get one of many other competitors and save a few dollars. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a protein for specific needs for health issues or for cooking, I’d probably recommend this above any I’ve ever had; and that’s many. This is safe for those with diabetes, it’s Keto Certified, Gluten-Free, low in Lactose for those dealing with stomach issues and it’s grass fed without any hormones. It’s also Non-GMO and GMP Certified and made in an FDA Registered Facility.<br />  It mixes with essentially anything, due to it being unflavored, which is pretty nice. I would highly recommend this for everyone, especially if you’re in the market for something so specific; I think this is as good as it gets for its specialties.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40579
40580,4.0,A Fantastic Mix!,"I think this is a really great mix of healthy goodness and it’s actually made from Acerola Cherries. Yummy!😁 I generally don’t like anything tasting like cherries accept fresh cherries, because of cough medicines but, this is from real cherries and is really good.<br />  Selling it all in a kit, combining the Dry or Deoiled Lecithin is a fine idea too. Lecithin oil is everywhere but, this has been tough to come by through the years, especially before the Internet. This combination can definitely help to keep a Cold away and keep the Brain flowing and help my Joints not ache.<br />  My only issue is that I always want information on the product I’m taking, how it’s tested for purity, etc and I don’t see anything about it. As I’ve stated, I think it’s a great product and I’d imagine that the actual process of even making it from cherries would be a good little story and selling point for them to add along with the testing information; GMP Certified, 3rd Party Tested etc. There’s lots of competition to keep up with.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40580
40581,4.0,Healthy Carbs!,"I’m still learning about keeping the body in Ketosis but, I know it’s a healthier way to keep the energy going. It says it’s made of Pea Starch, which seems to be pretty healthy to me.😁 This particular one is flavorless so, I just mix it in with my protein drink, shake it up and I’m proverbially, Off to the Races.<br />  It’s also GMP Certified, made in an FDA Approved Facility and done so in the USA.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",40581
40582,3.0,It’s Comparable in Quality; Not Price.,"I generally try stay away from these types of products these days because they have Soy Protein in them but, they are good though. I’ve drank hundreds of Ensure in the past as I was healing and I know it was a big part of my getting better and this is quite comparable to it. I think it’s a good product but, I find it to be quite pricey when I compare it to Ensure, which is what it says to do on the front of the label.<br />  If the price is right and you either need a quick pick-me-up or you’re healing like I was, I would definitely recommend this stuff.<br />  Happy Health Everyone!😁",40582
40583,5.0,Pretty Cool!,"I tried this on a hat and it seems to work well. I thought it would be great in the rain. I think I may try it on a jacket of mine. Anyway, it’s easy to use, doesn’t have any unwanted smell to it and is supposed to last about 9 to 12 months. Pretty awesome if it does!😁<br />  I’m definitely glad I tried it and would recommend it.",40583
40585,5.0,Astounding!!!😁,"I’ve been using protein supplements from their infancy and am consistently impressed by their amazing evolution from those terrible tasting days. This one truly takes the proverbial Cake though. These are not only decent tasting, but they taste good.<br />  This tiny 2.5 ounce bottle, which is easily drank in one shot, has 26 grams of Protein Hydrolysate, which is a form that’s essentially had the protein broken down to a smaller molecular level to make it Much easier for the body to use and it’s absorbed more completely. I’ve never seen anything like it; if this type has been around, it’s All new to me and I’m happy to know it’s here.<br />  This is a little box of 12 and I think it’s a fine deal for what these are. It may be a tad bit obvious but, I think I would recommend it to everyone; especially the dedicated Gym Rat, which I may not be now, but I always was and Still am at heart.😁<br />  Happy Health Everyone!",40585
40587,5.0,"Awesome, Pricey, but worth it!","I’m not knocking this product in the least because of the price; it’s simply what one pays for the convenience of a fantastic mix in a Recovery drink. I can do get all of this in a multitude of different supplements and I’d be saving quite a bit of coin but, if I’m busy and simply need the Proteins and everything else to avoid losing the muscle I’ve worked so hard on, then one if these sitting cold and ready in the Refrigerator may be a priceless item on a busy day such as that. I think these are made well and they have 18 grams of Protein, 20 grams of Collagen, 8g of Eaa, 5g of BCAA’s and lots of other essentials for a nice recovery.<br />  I would definitely recommend!<br />  Happy Health Everyone!😁",40587
40668,5.0,Convenient,Love these little soap sheets and have been looking for them for quite some time! Didn’t want to get an off brand because I wasn’t sure the quality would be as good. These are great! And they smell nice. 🙂 tysm!,40668

40872,5.0,I finally found it!!!!!!,"This scent I have been looking for over 2 years. It’s been obviously a secret with hotel spa casino resort apartment buildings, as not one person could ever get it right on what I was smelling at the Ocean Hotel Atlantic City or the beautiful apartments in Bay Harbor I stayed in of what actually this amazing scent was, and I HAD TO FIND IT!<br />I stumbled upon this Blaze Away from reading and being stuck on the review of a woman saying, “she could eat the fragrance,” and to me that was a sign (yeh don’t laugh) that this may be it! I’m going to tell you this is so amazing she’s not kidding! As for me, now when I come home after a 2 day business trip, I’m reminded of how AMAZING scent truly is and in fact I feel amazing like I do on vacation at the Ocean Resort!!!! I can’t believe I finally found it! Wow people keep secrets and I’m spilling. (Don’t be discouraged when spraying at first as it’s intense and I didn’t even notice the notes it’s so strong.) I left on business returned in 3 days and was just overcome with amazement 🫢 as this IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! I didn’t know until I let it settle as it is VERY CONCENTRATED! It’s why it’s expensive, not because it’s a “name brand” it’s actually amazing! Anyways if you love apples and a smell of clean maybe melon and a hint of lemon zest possibly a tad note of lavender, or you been to the Ocean Resort, you will be in heaven at home pre your next vacation on a daily basis! It’s WORTH EVERY PENNY BUT yes…..wish it was a bigger bottle I’m a junkie to this smell. Thank You Blaze Away!! I’m finally home! ❤️🙌",40872

41743,3.0,Don't believe the hype or you'll be disappointed too 😥,"To say that I was excited to try this product is an understatement.  I combed through reviews and read French Pharmacy recommendations until my eyeballs nearly fell out.  I hit the ""Buy it Now"" feature and two days later it was at my door.<br />I was impressed by the size of the tube of product, I mean, no one can say they didn't get their money's worth.  The cream however failed to perform.  It's not spreadable, you run it across your face and it just seems to dry out.  When I read ""hyaluronic acid"" I imagined that it would be more of a gel based lotion and, it's not.  It literally made no difference on my face whatsoever and, I ended up mixing in a little hyaluronic acid in it whilst in my hand to get it to be more functional.  There are still some great French Pharmacy products out on the market that are worth the hype, this however is just not one of them. 😥",41743

43448,5.0,I got the Ulla after checking out all the different hydration assistance tech.,"I totally LOVE my Ulla, I tend to forget to eat or drink during the day. I've done this all the time I worked and now since I retired.  I've been having problems with being dehydrated lately so I researched the tech to help you stay hydrated.  I felt the bottles that remind you to drink were too expensive and I didn't like having to put all of my water bottles, mug, and whatever, away and use only one.  When I first round the Ulla i was so happy!  Once I tried it i was thrilled!!!!  It fits easily on every bottle, mug, can, or anything i drink out of!  I am getting in the habit of drinking whenever I see a flashing light 😊.  It is noticeable when my bottle is On the end table or to the side of me.  It is far from annoying or irritating it is fun to use and I enjoy the single flash that I take as meaning &#34;Good job&#34;!  It is also much less expensive than the others i checked out.  I can't think of any cons except right now I can't find it because I keep changing what it is one. 😊  OH, maybe I should get a couple different colors and sayings ☺😊😁😀😊☺",43448

43821,5.0,UNBELIEVABLE,"I just found the influence videos on Amazon, not long ago. I saw a long demo with this pink product.  I had to try it.  I have lived in my house for 27 years and have glass on my shower.  I have used EVERYTHING to try to clean the glass(along with any cleaning person who I have hired over the years) and NOTHING has made my glass clear.<br />Well I am here to tell you……THIS IS A MIRACLE!  We can se out of our shower glass.  It just fogs up now!!!!! I use the pink 1x a week and I feel like I have a new shower.<br />I started testing this product out on other surfaces and so far it has worked on everything with no damage or residue.<br />I’m no pro so please test your spots but for my family, this is a MAIN STAPLE.  I feel like I should be one of those people in the stores selling the stuff.<br />Seriously you need to try it😃<br /><br />I just found out that I can take spray paint off my hands with PINK!!!!!! HOWS THAT FOR GREAT!!!<br /><br />I am adding to my review months later…..I am a crafter of ALL SORTS.  I’ve had spray paint and dye ink on my hands for days and NOTHING has worked to make my hands look presentable UNTIL….. I was in the bathroom getting something from the cabinet and saw my “PINK”. I figured it couldn’t hurt to try.  Well I dug some out and got a hand luffa .  I was buffing away my paint filled hands!  IT WORKED ON CLEANING MY HANDS AND my skin still looks great. It’s not damaged.  GET YOUR “PINK “ people.  You won’t regret it 😎",43821

45970,2.0,Didn't Work for Me,"I bought this product because of the reviews. I needed to remove rust off of an old wooden bench, an old milk can, and a decorative outdoor bell. I used about 4oz acid with two quarts of hot water and then added it to our pressure washer. ... Nothing. I then used a scrub brush dipped in water with full strength acid. It removed the rust on the milk can but not the bench or the bell. It lightened the color, but the rust is still there. I'm very disappointed in the results. 😔",45970
46145,5.0,Smooth nail edges means these files are a must have!,"Drea here. Brian doesn't use or need nail files, but my two girls and I very much do lol. I have always used Emory boards and each of us own a 7 sided nail buffer. I purchased a bunch of nail care items and while I was watching YouTube I came across a young lady using a crystal nail file. It was my first time ever seeing one, but I wanted it lol. You get a plastic pouch that has 5 files in it. Each file is in it's own vinyl sheath. You get a pretty blue, an almost blood red, a baby pink, a goldfish yellow and a purple nail file. I gave each girl a different colored file (just to be sure they wouldn't fight over just one file) and reminded them to only file their nails in ONE direction. If you use a see sawing motion you will cause the nail's free edge to split. They each used the file and loved the smoothness it gave the edge. I used mine and I concur with my girls. These crystal files are way better than Emory boards. They are washable and I love the little black cloth that it comes with. This gets 5 &#34;Smiling Nails&#34; or stars from me, and they are so worth the money 😁",46145

46972,5.0,Too cold to go smoke outside? This is magic,We live 300 miles south of the Artic circle and winters here are very cold. So cold I don’t want to go outside to smoke my 🌲s. This almost completely solves my issue. I can exhale big fat smoke clouds into this and nothing comes out the other end. It doesn’t help the residual smoke that comes out of the pipe or whatever when your not smoking it but it does exactly what it claims and I’m seriously impressed. I’ll be buying more of these!,46972

50617,1.0,"I’d Definitely Pass Based on My Experience... the Mask is okay, don’t like ear loops - they pull","Do not buy if you need this soon. Maybe it’s changed (when I ordered ratings were fine but by the time I was WAITING-it was awful) but It took too long for me. Over a couple months. It’s Okay. I’m severely disappointed in this purchase due to severe shipping delays and unnecessary deception!  I would have accepted the truth. Maybe they were overloaded with orders. All well they appeared to be instead severely taking advantage, and leading in to many of us about when it was supposedly shipped.<br /><br />I know when things are shipped and track USPS in texts from all sellers. They don’t hold back products.<br />...🍃💜🍃 I won’t waste energy badmouthing- I give honest straight reviews. Rarely poor, bad-and not pleased. Lots of grace and patience. So I contacted the seller twice. They are not truthful in when I would receive the package (masks). I waited and waited when I could have made another choice or get a refund! And when all this Covid started I needed truth not lies. I rarely write a bad review. I’m not happy. Well really I’ve let go lol 😂 Sorry but truth is real. I always speak from the heart, not emotion, facts. Move on in my opinion. I ordered from someone else- I am so pleased. I found them months later on Instagram. Got as stated in a few days via USPS for which I get texts every stop even from label making-👍🏻☀️🌱☀️😊 (you can sign up for much of this on the USPS website and more for free). The company went above and beyond.<br />I don’t put other sites names on to to bash on other people in reviews even though I want to do bad here grrrr. I read many others were waiting and unhappy while I was waiting on these people and got their money back. Well, I waited it out.  But still it only proved their deception.  ‘we delivered it on this day’ yeah right-NOT!<br /><br />Move in order from someone else unless this company has turned around since this review. Then I am all for fairness as I said- I usually give the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Happy mask shopping.<br />I do recommend am adjusting ear part, which this did not have, it just pulled which over time (like wearing during a massage) can cause discomfort.  It’s not the easiest to breathe in, but stands up to washing and is not a bad mask if you wait out delivery or if they improve delivery. I like the material. I just love my new cost efficient mast for less money, free shipping, carbon inserts (yes replacements) and nose metal replacements, and quick free shipping I was able to track via USPS via text and email step by step. Wonderful, hassle-free. Not hard to find.<br /><br />Hope this helps. That’s why I come back and share~ I wish someone had done the same 🌼😊💦🍃💦🌱👍🏻<br /><br />❤️🧡💜 have a great day! 💜🌱💙🌱❤️🌱",50617

50845,3.0,The seals on the jar need improved,"I’m sooooo disappointed. I was very excited to receive these scents and opened then right away. Some of the Rosemary and Eucclyptus leaked in the box; maybe a better seal would help. The cinnamon smells like dirty feet, the Lavender smells NOTHING LIKE Lavender and putrid 😰. The others all just smell like each other except for the Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Begamot, and Ylang Ylang; which all smell just as they should. The Frankincense smells like nothing at all; I buy Frankincense somewhere else so I know what it is supposed to smell like. I think the lesson is some products should not be purchased on line.",50845

56014,5.0,Snuggly soft and super warm,"This is a great heated throw/blanket.<br />For me, it arrived at the perfect time, as our temperatures dipped significantly the night it arrived.<br />Consequently, I pulled this out of it box and popped it onto my bed first chance I get.<br /><br />Size-wise, I would consider this a one person blanket/throw.<br />If you turned it sideways, you could snuggle under it with a partner, but I think the best way to take advantage of it would be to selfishly keep it all to yourself. 😁<br /><br />The fabric is a very soft fleece in a camel color.<br />It's extra appealing, particularly since other heated throws I had were much scratchier.<br />This one is genuinely extra appealing to use, even when the heat is off.<br /><br />The controls for this blanket are quite simple and straightforward.<br />The power button (larger one in photo) works on a slide, so you are not likely to unintentionally turn this on.<br />The heat level works on a push button that you just click until the one of three available options you prefer is illuminated.<br />The automatic shut off for the heat kicks in after two hours, so this is not an all night heated throw/blanket, unless you want to wake up to turn it back on throughout the night.<br />This does, however, work very well as a lap blanket or as a way to quickly heat up your bed before you crawl in.<br /><br />The range of heat is hard to describe, but I would describe it as going from just noticeably warm to hot, but not uncomfortable.<br />This does not get at hot as a heating pad, but the top setting is still pretty toasty.<br /><br />When it comes time to wash this, the cord disconnects easily.<br />I included a photo of the washing instructions, which include both hand and machine options depending on your preference.<br /><br />The cord on this is nice and long, but whether it will work for you obviously depends a lot on where you want to use it and how close it is to an outlet.<br /><br />Overall, I am thrilled with this heated throw/blanket.<br />This is an ideal way for staying warm in a cold room.<br />It would be an absolutely perfect gift for someone who always complains about being cold when they are seated.<br />I am completely thrilled with the texture, appearance, and function of this heated throw/blanket and would recommend it as an excellent value.",56014

56669,1.0,BubbleBliss Deluxe failed on all three: no bubbles & certainly wasn’t blissful or deluxe.,"Not only did mine not bubble, but if it heated the water it certainly wasn’t enough to be described as ‘soothing’ like the box claims. It was about as loud as a hand vacuum. I was also disappointed that even though it says it goes up to a men’s 12, the recommended waterline is so low that it wouldn’t cover my feet (size 10) so they weren’t even submerged. The air intake vent is on the bottom of the product, literally the part that sits flush to the floor. A bunch of other people encountered the no bubbles problem online and said to only use it on hard surfaces, but that didn’t fix the problem.<br /><br />And this last one is a small complaint, but this model is not designed for use with anything in the water, so no Epsom salts.<br /><br />The only positive is that it did hold water without leaking so we were able to at least just rest out feet in the hot water we had already poured in. 🙄",56669

57143,5.0,Cool mop!,I previously purchased a mighty thirsty mop  & just needed a bucket. I searched all around and the square buckets are just too expensive & big but I found this mop/ bucket combo. Amazon had a used one for a fraction of the cost and I pounced on it. Haha. Thank you Amazon for being a good & honest seller marking it down and disclosing it was previously sold & used. It was in fine condition and hardly used.<br />The mop is neat! It automatically wrings it self due to engineering and a sliding mechanism. It’s ingenious. I’m not sure if I like it more than the mighty thirsty but I tell you it is equal if not better. If you have arthritis or weak hands this is the mop for you 😄!  You just put the mop in the bucket and push down on the handle like if you were rinsing it. Super easy. Oh and it is very absorbent. You really have to put water on it to use it unless you are soaking up a huge spill.,57143
57177,5.0,Perfect!,"It's super hot and leaves really nice tiny waves. Don't know what the complaints were for maybe it may have been on a wrong setting. It's easy to mistake the high and low settings because it's a little different from the American settings. The numbers are the same as ours but instead of automatically pushing the dial thing up to the very top... the highest number is actually at the bottom. Its sort of like those anime books. You read them backwards compared to Americas reading ours foward.<br />Anyways, i love it! My only problem will be that my last iron...the handle thing broke off. Where your finger goes. So I hope it doesn't happen to this one. (The other one was from here...not from amazon)<br />You really should beware of the hot though lol. Really hot the way i like it but you should know what you're doing or else just use a low setting 👍🙂",57177

57607,5.0,Sparkling coffee pot!,"Worked very well. Easy to use but took two treatments. Also, let the solution sit five or six hours or even overnight. Afterwards it had “loosened” the stain on our stainless steel carafe (oxymoron there 😉) and I used a long bottle brush to clean the remainder. It’s not quite as good as Dip It but almost as good. However, it’s easier to use also and you get many more uses. DipIt is no longer available except at a ridiculously high price.",57607
57776,4.0,Don't kniw,I don't know how accurate this was. Because i know i can't drink milk but it was ok in my report😳 so i was a bit disappointed bcz i don't know if i can rely on the rest of my report or my daughter's,57776

58270,5.0,So freakin' cute & accurate,"I literally cannot stop looking at him😍 he even got his own shelf with him in the middle BC his stance is so bold &adorable lol. I originally ordered the Nindroid version that came with kage that was $70 but this one was only $20 and it's perfect in every sense from the paint to the little stand that comes with an underside sticky if you want to permanently put it somewhere but can be removed also if you want it as just a stand. His hair is even textured if that makes sense, I'm so happy I found this, very tempted to get all of them..  Long live Bojji!!😍",58270
58596,5.0,Super “ superfood “ !,"This is my first experience with Alma. I saw a medical show that mentioned Alma has the most antioxidants and vitamin C and is considered a “ super-superfood “. It’s anti-viral and also helps with memory, blood glucose, eye and brain health. And I want some of that 🙏 . Plus it’s natural and has been used for a thousand years in ancient medicine. So, while it’s hard to tell the benefits of supplements until you take them for 30 - 60 days, this one I’m excited to add to my daily regimen. The price is not cheap for a 30 day supply, but if you spend your money on the right ones, you can reduce your overall supplements significantly I believe. And good health is much cheaper then illness 🙏🙏",58596
58604,4.0,Extract vs root powder 🤔🤔,"Well, this is my first trial of Red Ginseng, so I will learn better as I go. I have already learned that the extract version ( as this ) is not as good as the pure root powder,  no matter what the amount of Ginsenosides is in it. There are multi types of ginsenosides  I have read,  and the type, is more important that the amount . You can research yourself and see that the price of pure root powder is higher and some even list the types of ginsenosides in it. This may be a fine addition to boost your immune system or even a fine maintenance dose, but if you’re looking for results you can feel , you may want to try the root powder. That’s my next purchase . Do your research, these supplements and adaptogens are confusing and many sellers rely on you focusing in on specific words to make the sale. No complaints, I’m just going to keep investigating.🙏",58604
58607,5.0,"Extract, not an oil .","The selling point here is that it’s an extract, not just an oil . And the extract has a higher quantity of the thymoquinone, which is the power behind Black Seed. This is a time tested herb, with a thousand years of usage. There are many more benefits or possible benefits than are even listed here, such a inflammation, digestion, asthma and even cancer fighting. This is an essential fatty acid that the body cannot produce. Certainly read up on it. I have been taking the 500mg oil pills for years ( as they are cheaper ) and I’m excited to try this extract and see how it affects my aging body. Give your body what it needs 🙏",58607
58608,5.0,I’m hopeful 🙏,"I just got this today and honestly I’m a little skeptical, but I see these neck “slings“ advertised and popular and my neck is one of the places that my morning exercise routine can’t stretch. This seems a little easier to use and store than a sling. And since getting older, I’m feeling a little arthritis maybe and lots of crackling noises that I think are from childhood abuses and sports. And it makes sense that stretching any muscle or spine area is going to loosen it up. So let’s give it a try. It’s a simple device and 10 minutes a day is easy. I would warn about going slow your first time as your spine is everything and you don’t want to do anything to affect it negatively. That being said, day 1 feels good . I even put it behind my head in my chair for awhile as the chairs have no real support for the neck. I’m hopeful 🙏🙏",58608
58611,5.0,Great for other things too !,"Well, to be fair, I bought this for my wife who was having knee pain. She’s a tiny woman and none of the normal knee wraps seemed to suit her. I thought we could make our own wrap to fit her knee. Well, it didn’t work for that purpose, but not because of any product failure. These are actually well made and long . I laid it next to my guitar in the photo for comparison. I tried them on and though they are meant for weightlifting, they would work great as knee support when we hike. I didn’t feel it slipping at all , but maybe the way you wrap it matters. I followed the online photos . No one puts instructions with the product anymore 😔😔 But the wrap is great and I plan on using it hiking, as my knees suffer going down steep paths . Nothing negative to say 🙏",58611
58651,3.0,I don't taste the subtle sweetness nor nutty  😏,"I don't like the taste, but it's healthy ( vitamins, minerals, and protein ). I can sprinkle it on other foods and drinks to mask it's taste. I made a nice smoothie today with it, with other ingredients masking it's taste. I strive to consume things healthy for snacks.🙂<br />THX to delivery person for following delivery instructions 👍; 5 stars to them.",58651

I can’t wait to use this on my legs after a workout from the lactic acid build up. I’m going to buy this for every one of my sibling for Christmas ❤️❤️❤️",59980
60358,4.0,Nice for skin and hair,"Really enjoy this oil for my hair and skin.

63000,2.0,Buyers beware about extendable memory,"I purchased this tablet for my father because he was completely out of space on his old tablet, and this one had an expandable memory space.  The only problem is....the expanded memory cannot be used to save app data.  Since he doesn't take pictures or video with the tablet, the extra 125G sd card that I got for it is is pretty useless 😑  And it barely had space for all of his apps.  He loves it for the screensize and it has enough base memory to allow him a few more apps than his old one....so 3 stars.  Still wish that I had known about the tablet not allowing the extended memory to be used for apps in any way...I would have gotten a different tablet.",63000

65313,5.0,Small and easy to swallow,"Not all Vitamin D3 are the same. You have to pick the strength you want (we always get 5.000 IU after so much research).

66418,5.0,One Million Percent Recommend!,"I love this stuff! It cleans and disinfects my contacts the best out of all the other ones. My contacts always feel and perform the best on days when I’ve used this to soak them in all night. They are super clear, and don’t get all blurry on me when I use this. However because the soaking time is 6 hours, I recommend that you also keep a regular contact solution for quick cleans, rewetting, and storing. Because you can’t just stick your contacts back in your eyes after using this. It will burn if you do. So, you definitely need something like Biotrue, Optifree, or ReNu. Amazing product for sure though! 👍🏼👀👁",66418

67851,1.0,DO NOT TRUST: BEWARE:: SNAKE OIL,"🍃I am highly questioning the integrity of this product. First of all, these  gummies taste nothing like apple cider vinegar. I’ve been taking goli’ brand apple cider gummies, (500mg per serving) and this company is claiming it contains (1550mg per serving) THREE TIMES MORE??? How do they hide the taste of apple cider vinegar??? IMPOSSIBLE if it is actually in there!!!  I highly question its contents.<br /><br />***There is no regulation for these companies selling supplements on Amazon. Many also claim they are made in the US, when they are actually manufactured in China.<br /><br />(goli’ brand has the mildly distinct taste of ACV, as it should)!!!! and btw, it tastes good and it works!!! It has balanced my gut, and lowers my appetite..<br />This brand, well, has done nothing; I did not feel any different. I sincerely believe it is SNAKE OIL. They are small and taste like a sugar gel gummy…nothing more than that.<br /><br />I went further to look up this Neurogan company, and all that comes up is a company that sells CBD products. ????<br /><br />(Back to using goli’—which IS made in a FDA registered and cGMP certified facility in the USA).",67851

68312,5.0,You can never go wrong with FoF,"Ive used FoF for 17 years now and it has proven to be the best thing ever for anxiety, nervousness, insomnia and other such nonsense the universe throws at me. I got a shepherd as a service dog for my autistic daughter and she gets wound up when I take her to the vet. Two pinches of the dropper bulb does the trick for her and she is able to be calm around all the smells and noise associated with a vets office. I also use it on myself to help me unwind and shut my mind off long enough to go to sleep, otherwise I wouldnt sleep. I give it to my daughter whenever she feels anxious and within 15 minutes at the longest, she is able to settle down from her anxiety or nervousness or whatever starts to wound her up. Its amazing stuff. I keep three bottles in the house at all times. Its as much a part of our lives as water and air 😉",68312

Will update as I use it more!<br /><br />Reason for order: I ordered this because I sit in the car for about 25 hours a week so my posture is beginning to slumped forward.<br /><br />Update - After three days of wearing my lower back hurts a teeny bit but I assume that’s because my shoulders are actually back for the first time 😂😂 will update more in a few weeks.,70521

71274,1.0,Quality not good,"Loved the glasses when they first arrived. I used them for choir twice a week, so I don’t have to keep taking my readers on and off.  Now, after six weeks, the side has fallen off. I tried to fix with a new screw, but the hole doesn’t line up. I’m out the money😡",71274
71400,1.0,Not buying again,Maybe I'm not seeing well but this looks nothing like what I see online as a 4oz package. Used this first the first time and I really don't like the smell which has a black pepper smell 😔😔😔 so weird.,71400

71602,5.0,So far so good,"My glasses are always sliding down my nose and these seem to be helping quite a bit. I like how thin they are. A lot of other kinds seem to be a bit thicker, so these are more discreet. I would recommend these 🙂",71602
71604,5.0,Both chewables and high potency liquid iron are yummy and they work too!!!,"My elderly mother and I have both struggled with iron deficiency anemia for pretty much our entire lives. My ferritin level on my labs a year ago was 16. According to my doctor, it should be MINIMUM 75-90 range. I was previously using a product called Vitron C for over a decade which based on my labs clearly wasn’t working. I tried SlowFE too which was crap lol. After a lot of research on what iron was best for me, something I could take on an empty stomach without pain AND also tasted great, I stumbled across NovaFerrum pretty much by accident. I’m SO glad I did! I started taking 1 chewable every day and my most recent labs show my ferritin number went up to 22! That might not seem like a big increase in a year but when you struggle for as many decades as I have with how to get numbers up, let me tell you this increase is very very good. So much so, that I’ve had my mom taking the high potency liquid version (her ferritin is even lower than mine and she can’t chew very well) - she loves it! I also increased my consumption to 2 chewables a day 🙂 they do truly taste great. I can’t taste any iron/coppery ickyness at all, and my mom says there’s a very slight aftertaste but isn’t bad at all and if you find that you don’t like that tiny aftertaste, mix it in a shot of your favorite juice. You don’t even need a full cup lol. NovaFerrum has done an amazing job! I just recently purchased their new liquid multivitamin with elderberry and I can’t wait to try that one too. I am definitely a lifetime customer! I highly recommend their products for everyone from children to elderly ages. I do suggest you buy these directly from NovaFerrum’s website though… they’re much cheaper than Amazon has listed and NovaFerrum will even email you coupon codes for discounts from time to time. Win win!",71604

71647,5.0,The best aluminum cleaner! ®,It's really amazing MAGIC!!! 😳😳😳😳,71647
71659,4.0,Worth a try!,"Overall review - Good, I like it.  I personally have to reapply about every 4 hours, because I have oily skin, so the tackiness wears off sooner than I'd like.  I have yet to experience any skin breakdown or breakouts, which is a major plus.  The only downfall for me is the price point @ $10.99/tube, but when you consider how long the product could last (depending on usage), then it's not all that bad.  But don't lose it! It's the size of a standard chapstick tube and could easily be misplaced. 😉",71659
71703,5.0,Two thumbs up,"Mind you , my neck is not as long as I thought it was so I ordered the wider neck brace . My bad 😂 Having said that I’m certainly not sending it back for the shorter one because these collars can be adjusted easily enough . I’ve had both neck and back broken and that sort of thing never actually heals 100% . I have for aches to mow on a large zero turn and it’s quite a rough ride . I’d be in pain until it was time to mow again Because my neck can’t take the abrupt jarring . Now I not only strap on my back support but neck support as well and have fun in my mower like it should be !!! I recommend this neck collar . 👍🏻💯",71703

73264,5.0,A very useful item that makes my life more comfortable.,"This little pouch is very helpful. I was a bit sceptical that it would really work allowing a phone entry through the plastic. I was pleasantly surprised that it works perfectly. There is a strap that holds my phone in place, so I am able to put several small items in the pouch, as well.  All-on-all, I love my rolling walker, the pouch is a great add on. My physical therapist recommended both items and her suggestion is right on target 🎯!!",73264

76480,5.0,Attitude with gratitude.,The bottle is bigger than what I expected. It was tightly sealed and fresh when I opened it.

76556,1.0,Buyer Beware! Save Yourself! Run!,"Waste of money! I tossedthem in the trash just now after receiving a Not So Helpful email response from the seller. The Online Presentation is far from what you will receive in the mail. You don't know if they've been used as they come unsealed in a jewelery pouch! They're extremely small and will most likely be difficult to remove from the vagina and will also fall right out. Please Save yourself. Save your Money. Go to benwaballs.com which is ""more reputable"" where you will get exactly what you're looking for! This company isn't it! 😐",76556
76560,5.0,Taste great and give me so much energy!! ⚡️,"I loooove Spark and have been getting it for years! So happy it’s now sold on Amazon 😆<br />I got the variety pack to try new flavors before I get my next canister. These on-the-go packets are great to add to a bottle of water when you need a pick-me-up during the day. It says each stick pack makes 8oz prepared, but it will taste just as good diluted into a 16oz water bottle and last much longer. Unlike energy drinks, they are not carbonated, so you can drink as much or as little as you want and save the rest for later. That’s what I do. Can’t wait to try all the different flavors like green apple. My go to has always been fruit punch and watermelon. This WILL give you tons of natural energy. It hits me more than coffee and makes me feel like working out (not my thing). Definitely worth a try!",76560

77736,1.0,"""NOT ON MY NIGHTSTAND""","I received one of these dream tones as a gift.  The only good thing I can say about it is the size , it takes up very little space on any nightstand or table. It measures  4 1/4&#34; in height and almost 3 1/2&#34; in diameter.  The dome on mine isn't at all blue, as it appears in the photo, It is plastic ,silver color and comes off the base fairly easy , without any assistance. There are a couple dozen little cut out stars and a moon in the center for the 5 different color lights to shine through onto your walls or ceiling. A limey yellow, cobalt blue, lavender , shamrock green, and a red are the colors to choose from. The sounds are okay. The rain, waves crashing against rocks, a heatbeat, crickets and night time critters, different bird chirping (pleasant enough) and finally water running in a creek bed, or just a bathtub filling up. My biggest issue is the volume,  there is a separate  up and down volume button, and a speaker right in the front measuring  1 1/2&#34;  round, but is very loud , even turned completely down . I put a few pieces of scotch tape over the speaker , it helped. It's battery powered, taking 3 AA's. The round base twists off to access the batteries.  there is no access for a  DC ADAPTOR for plugging into a wall outlet. I also have the homemedics SS-2000 G/F AMZ SOUND SPA RELAXATION MACHINE, silver/white that I have been using and have been happy with for more then 6 years. It uses AA batteries and comes with a power cord for outlet use as well. Amazon offers it for $ 19.99 , it measures  6 1/2&#34; × 6&#34; in diameter,  and is about  2&#34;  high. It also offers a 15 , 30 , and 60 minute auto  shut - off timer which can be very useful For some. These two sound machines are as different as night and day, fire and snow, and rhode island and texas. But this is just my own opinion. 🌜 THANKS FOR READING, BYE🌛",77736
78045,5.0,AMAZING!!! 5 stars!!,"As a heavyset family we have gone through a lot of rolly stools/chairs. But this one is AMAZING!! It was easy to assemble and glides across the tile floor.

Yes it’s a little pricy but it is DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!<br /><br />I cannot like this enough - 5 stars!!<br /><br />🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<br /><br />Planning on purchasing a second one soon!",78045

80958,4.0,Energized for the Morning at least!,I have been taking these vitamins about 2 weeks now. I take it in the morning. I learned the hard way that I have to eat at least 1-2 minutes before taking the pill. My stomach hurt and my side and back hurt instantly! When I eat though this doesn't happen. Also this is CRAZY but when I take it each time my neck and arms ITCH LIKE CRAZY and Felt like they burned a bit for no longer than maybe 10-15 minutes. It scared me at 1st but I'm used to it now and it doesn't last as long now! I don't know why but I'm still alive for the moment at least!😂. I like the energy it gives me in the early morning.

83655,5.0,Invest! Amazing! Baby blow outs up the back NO MORE!!,"Bought these for my granddaughter.<br />My daughter will never use anything else.<br />Ironically, defying my comprehension, baby blow outs are NO MORE! When my little granddaughter is wet she does not react as she did in commercial diapers. ???😦??? I think the thing that really blows my mind is how they clean up. No poo stains. No lingering urine scent, nada. I will say, my daughter only washes via the directions provided. After much fabric research in her decision to go cloth there is something to be said of proper washing. I’m old school, Toss em in hot water and bleach the *bleep* outta them, NOT! I have spent roughly $400-$500 for the lifetime amount needed of these little diapers. My daughter never has to buy a bag of store bought again. Within 4 months of baby’s life, all her diaper needs are completed. That’s awesome and worth every single penny.<br />Side note: one size lasts all weight/growth stages of baby’s diapering life via snaps. 😮",83655

Shipment is quick and if you want a custom order, email her. I had her throw the ingredient for sensitive teeth into mine.",84341

88786,4.0,Lift saver!,"This body wash add is a life saver. A must have for my fellow ""mobility challenged"" friends. If you have joint or other mobility issues you know it can be hard or even a painful task showering. If you can't bend, you can't reach and a thorough cleaning can be difficult. This tool is a game changer and does the deed. The design is excellent but the yellow silicone is a little bit to hard to clean ""the front"" but it works great for the backend. If the silicone was softer it would be the perfect tool for front and back. 👍😉",88786

The oil is  very thick, a very very light fragrance you can’t barely distinguish one aroma  from the other except for peppermint 😮 … on top of everything it clogged the oil diffuser… and the seller has the nerve to offer $10.00 reward if you give a good review 😖😢.",91422
91554,4.0,Great Toothbrush!,"We have had this product for 20 days and it had made brushing my son's teeth so much easier. He loves it, but more so we love it! The 360° brush allows us to brush workout having to worry about actually ""getting the tooth"" because the whole thing is bristles. The light is perfect for setting all his new teeth coming in since he doesn't like to keep his mouth open very long and the design is perfect. My husband and I have relatively small hands so this fits perfectly! The only down side I have seen is somehow we lost 2 bristle rings. It doesn't seem like any other are loose, but I definitely give all brush a tug before brushing my son's teeth now. I took 1 star for that! 😁",91554

After reading the reviews, I decided to give them a shot. I was skeptical, but OMG THEY WORK!!!!😍 They really, truly work!!

93100,1.0,Meh,"I’m not picky but these are super gross borderline rancid.  Are used to formulate nutritional and supplement products so I know firsthand how hard it’s is to NATURALLY flavor anything with pumpkin ‘SPICES’.  The CLOVE spice causes most oils to oxidate & go rancid in a VERY short period of time... which is what these bars taste exactly like they have done.  Many people think pumpkin spice is a seasonal thing but flavor houses and formulators no pumpkin spice isn’t shelf stable and his best marketed as an on-demand food option.<br />👍🏽👍🏽The texture, moisture and digestibility are on point!! I love it enough I will be buying their other flavors.<br />🦃 /🎄 These could be absolutely delicious when fresh but I picked up this box on sale this spring, in hopes of it being a yummy option. I should purchase it this fall when it’s FRESH and compare.",93100
93152,3.0,Eh,"Personally, I find that the vibration is really powerful, it overkill, really. It's not like the fine hum type of vibration that you get from some of the higher grade electric toothbrushes, for example. It's challenging to describe vibration, but the vibration on this toothbrush is more of a buzz than a hum, more of a macro than a micro, more of an obtuse than an acute, more powerful than gentle. What can I say, it is a toothbrush, and it does vibrate, and I will use it until I'm able to upgrade, but this toothbrush is maybe better for individuals with zero dental issues and who don't have sensitive teeth/gums. It is very pretty though, I got the white with rose gold. And I do love how many toothbrush heads they send out with it. That's definitely 👍👍. The quality of the vibration though....",93152

93423,5.0,It’s a hard YES for me,"Rescue remedy has been helping me manage my stress and anxiety for almost two decades. I thought I wouldn’t be necessarily impressed by these gummies, mainly because I know what I was expecting and would have been completely happy with that. But no, I don’t know what additional ingredients are in the gummies versus the tincture (i think the gummies have gaba and saffron.. to name a couple)… these gummies made me feel warm, and fuzzy…. So relaxed. I had been having a day from absolute hell when I tried them and told my husband “this is the closest thing to a natural Xanax I’ve ever had”. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a Xanax… lol, but it DEFINITELY, impactfully relaxed me 😂🫶🏼",93423

You have to use it strictly by instructions which calls for not eating for 3 hrs before taking it at bedtime or during daytime no eating 3 hrs then taking 15 minutes before eating your meals.

96527,5.0,Cute small hot water bottle,"So first and foremost people need to realize that this hot water bottle is SMALL! It says that in the title. I purposely typed in the search SMALL hot water bottle and this is what came up. So all the people leaving bad reviews for it being too small obviously don’t read what they buy. The one odd thing is that the description doesn’t state that it comes with a cover, but that isn’t a problem because if you don’t like it it comes off, unlike a review that I read. If you just kinda squeeze the bottle while it’s insinde the cover it’ll slide right out. I only used this once so far, but it doesn’t seem to leak and it seems to stay warm for a good amount of time. Plus it’s pink!! I’m a sucker for anything pink 💖 would be great for traveling. I just needed it for a small area in my body and it’s serving it’s purpose.",96527

These had similar attributes so I decided to try.<br /><br />These of course have a more solid color, but it's quite dull. They also have a light smell, almost like sugary cereal.<br /><br />As for the taste, they taste quite bland. It's a bit chalky as well as pasty. It's not the most appealing considering it's more chewy as well. I don't really like the taste, but I do like the benefits it gives. It hasn't made my stomache upset using it or anything.<br /><br />Though, I still comparably like my other gummies compared to these because of how they taste. Otherwise, they still perform decent. Also, wish they were a bit smaller in sizing. 3/5<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for 📚 😊",97600

It is wonderful quality and worth the price!<br /><br />This massager is great for use in the car or on a computer chair etc.<br /><br />I love the heat function! It keeps my back nice and warm and relieves the aches.<br /><br />It has many different settings and modes. Each one feels very relaxing in a different way. I like to switch them every few minutes, it feels great!<br /><br /> I like that it also has a car outlet that way I can plug it into my car. I don’t have to worry about the battery dying because it’s plgged in all the time! It also has an outlet for the home if you want to use it at home!<br /><br />Great for sore muscles, heat or just to recharge your back!<br /><br />👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙👍🏼💙",99061
99099,5.0,My favorite!!,"Delicious! Actually tastes like a fuzzy navel and is super light and not an after taste like most protein drinks I’ve tried!<br />Mixes well, might need extra blending if there’s ice involved.<br />I had Bariatric surgery a year ago and Have grown to hate the heavy milkshake protein drinks and prefer the fruity- juice like flavors!

99385,2.0,Not what I expected.,I thought these would taste if not yummy at least good but sadly that wasn’t the case. The moment I opened the jar it smelled kind of odd and when I start chewing the gummies the flavor was even odder! Because of this I don’t think I will continue to eat them because I don’t enjoy them. I also noticed the pictures in the description shows the gummies being deep red in color but the ones I got are very dark purple 🤷🏻‍♂️ This order was just kind of disappointing to me…,99385

102506,1.0,A waste!,"Okay, so here's my comments on how this product worked for me. I took this for just under a Year!! My whole body is now having spasms and cramps, BIG TIME!!! I started to feel bad actually when i first brought it back in December of 2019, but I didn't realize that this product wasn't doing a dang thing for me!! I was taking two to 3 1/2 teaspoons a day and still nothing no help. My only conclusion is that the amount of magnesium is just too low to do any real good. My guess is the magnesium is just way too low and its meant for the consumer to buy and buy and of course you gotta use MORE AND MORE more money in their pockets!! I totally believed in this product but no more!!! I used this for too long and absolutely NO good came of it. I say STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!! IT'S USELESS!!! II have so many More negative symptoms after having used this product!!I've already ordered magnesium capsules they're coming tomorrow! Sorry Remag but I really want to give you 0 stars!! This product's taste wasn't so bad if you put it into a shake I never noticed it. I used it regularly for almost a year. In my opinion my faithfulness to the product is what made me not see clearly that it wasn’t working!! Maybe I should have used other magnesiums with it, but if i had done that than I would not of known that this product wasn't working ... I guess I know now!😡",102506
102515,3.0,Serious Design Flaws,Nosepiece is too stiff and will cause soreness on the bridge if your nose if worn a long time.

108244,1.0,Gross smelling & streaky.,"The orange mist cleaner, which my husband purchased the other day because I wanted the glass bottle, smells terrible and leaves horrible streaks all over my surfaces. I actually thought that my countertop had yet to be cleaned because it was so disgusting looking. I asked my husband if he had cleaned it and he said yes, he used the new cleaner. I called him into the kitchen and he was surprised too.<br /><br />I like their mission to supply the world with biodegradable and waste-free products, but not at the cost of not doing their job. I liked the overpriced bottle. I bought this to replace the plastic bottle I’ve been refilling for probably 10 years. I know, yuck.<br /><br />It says it’s safe for everything but there’s not a chance my counter was clean. If by some miracle it was, it absolutely looked terrible. I ended up grabbing my old standby, vinegar water, to clean off the streaks this cleaning product left behind.<br /><br />I wouldn’t give this product to my worst enemy.

112922,1.0,Doesn’t prevent your heels from slipping at all!,"I purchased these because I had a few pair of heels that kept slipping off of my heels when I walked so I needed something to help with that. I will NEVER put these in my shoes again. It was AWFUL!!!!!!! When I first put one in my shoe, it was crooked and I tried to move it to reposition it and it was tearing up the lining of my shoe! After some very very careful maneuvering, I was able to get it loose to move it but I don’t recommend letting it even slightly touch your shoe until you are 100% ready you want it in there. Finally, after proper placement in my shoe all it did was take up about half an inch of the back of my shoe shoving my toes into shoe. They did not grip my heel of my foot at all— they are smooth and don’t keep your foot from slipping out of the shoe so for all the trouble I received a pair of shoes that now have insides that look horrible, sore toes, and shoes that are little ugly on the inside but still slip  😏 I have used a brand before that worked perfectly if only I could remember which ones they were...",112922

113292,5.0,"Smells great, looks expensive. Full luxury experience.","I took the plunge and oh what a ride. This year we opted to utilize a fake 🌲 tree. Nothing shady, just easier for my family. Well during the first few days, we found we were missing the smell of a real tree. I searched online and found the company Scentcicles. AMAZED. I found the star from that listing along with a bell/ball style as well. An ornament you are thinking, yeah but with a bonus. The bonus here is the insert. Not only do you get to purchase gorgeous ornament - real metal btw, shiny and sparkly but also has a tiny corked insert that is presoaked with Balsam white fur tree scent. Hanging one ornament on the left and one on the right, our tree smelled like it was plucked from Santa’s home base at The NP. The directions are easy, open - insert, hang. Just that simple. Admittedly I am still enjoying the scent to this day - 02/26, going strong and smelling great. I hung in my coat closet until the scent fades. Then packing up for next year. Refills also available if needed. Win Win",113292

114927,5.0,A great variety,This set includes 4 different type of ear plugs the blue ones are the softest the do have a good amount of noise canceling effect hit not as much as the others. I was surprised when I opened the large box to my surprise they dwelt very soft and easily molded into another shape. With this set you are supposed to squeeze into a triangle and then insert into your ear it feels a bit odd but work amazing for what I needed. I live in. A small place and my roommate is hard of hearing she always has the tv up almost all the way she turn it down she can’t hear it and. To make matters worse she sleep with the tv on😔😩.so today wheni got home after work I tested them out to see if they wear with keeping or not and my oh my I sleep like a baby of course I still could hear the tv but the noise was dramatically decreased. The only issue in was having was not inserting them in far enough to actually work once I corrected that it worked like a charm. Best purchase I made this year!!!!,114927

Couldn't even fit flower petals in them, even though in the description they say they're for flower girls in weddings!! I was highly disappointed. We ended up using old easter baskets🤦🏻‍♀️ it was too close to the wedding day to find something different. What the heck do people even use these tiny bags for?!",115940

They were delivered with very good packaging. After a pack of strips is opened, they expire in 60 days. These strips were packaged in smaller packs so they will last longer and not expire so quickly. You will get very fast results. I have had the second or third color each time I used these, and I’ve done that about 10 times now. So they definitely work, they are changing color!  😁",117992

118091,3.0,Had to return,"This was too wide for my neck. Because of acid refux, I sometimes have to sleep sitting partway up, lounging against pillows. Naturally my head would sag after I fell asleep and I'd wake up with a neck ache, and worse, sometimes drooling all over myself. 😉 I tried propping pillows on my sides but they would just fall away. I finally decided to try a neck brace, and liked the idea of the option for pain and heat relief for other neck-aches, but it wss just too wide to fit comfortably under my chin. I did measure, but I think the position I found myself sitting in contributed to the ""shortening"" of my neck. All that said, it's well made and the fabric covering was far more comfortable than the narrower and much more basic design I ended up buying. A review can only represent one person's experiences based on their needs. There was nothing wrong with the product as far as I could tell in the short amount of time I had it; it just didn't fit my particular set of circumstances.",118091

The suction cup actually has a constant sucking motion its not just a steady latch. There is also a vibration function with different settings.

120108,1.0,Not worth it - and can stain white fiberglass!,"UPDATE:<br />The purple tablet was completely dissolved after 3 days sitting on the rear of the tub.  However, I saw there was a faint purple stain on the white fiberglass. Faint in that no-one else would notice it, but I knew where the tablet had sat and dripped, and could see the purple coloring. It didn't wipe off and neither did a spray and soak with bleach cleaner remove it!  Hopefully it'll fade, or maybe pure bleach will work if not.  The unused ones are in the trash!<br />.<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />.<br />I recently reviewed some other shower steamers and they weren’t very good.  I saw these in my Vine Listing and thought I’d try them and see if they were any better.<br />As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I am offered new-to-market products, if I want them, at no cost to me, in exchange for an honest, objective, and comprehensive review.<br />I get a laugh out of the spelling on the front; these are apparently Showen Steamers!  😊  At least the rear spelling is correct!<br />Interestingly, the package also includes a little purple nylon mesh bag and adhesive hook, presumably to hang a steamer block in.  There is also a little pick, which I have no idea what it is for.<br />However, after some thought, I think it might be to open the plastic wrap!  Each block is foil-wrapped, but unlike the previous steamers, these are also wrapped in plastic. That is very tough to remove without scissors, or a pick!  One set of blocks is green and the other is purple.  This is reflected in the actual crystal block as well as the foil.  I assume the purple is the Lavender.<br />I say ‘assume’ because the aroma is nothing like Lavender or Eucalyptus & Menthol.  It is certainly less “chemical” smelling than the previous set I reviewed, and perhaps less pungent in use, but I’ve no idea what the smell actually is.  There’s no comparison with the essential oils I have of these very scents.<br />As with any of these steamers, you have to place them away from the direct shower spray.  They will last less than one shower if you do.  I place one so that it is occasionally hit with water, to release the aroma.  That way it can last maybe 4 showers.<br />As mentioned, the aroma is not very strong and if hit with hot water, the block will release a burst of scent, which quickly dissipates and some of the coloring will run in the shower.  The scent can be overwhelmed easily by any scented bodywash or shampoo.  I certainly didn’t notice any residual aroma the next day, with the block having sat in the shower overnight.  I think the product would be better if it were a small tablet for a single use directly in the shower stream and the price were less than 50c each.<br />.<br />While this set is less offensive and strongly smelling than the last, I still would not spend my own money of these.  At $2.67 each, these are not good value and I can’t recommend them",120108
120121,1.0,Bad product!.,"It didn’t curl my lashes like the old clamp-type of curler, but I was ok with that. After about a month, it just stopped working.

120289,5.0,FINALLY!!!,"Yes finally, a mask that is TRUE to size and coverage. For the past 2 months I have become a self-proclaimed expert in useable mask. I have purchased, return and/or repurposed an assortment of mask that profess comfort, coverage & adjustability. The disappointment or simply settling for whatever had become chore. NOT ANY MORE. THANK YOU BUTTONSMITH! I have 4 clients who have rather large head/faces. Merchants who promised (large or XL) fell woefully below standards & size with misleading photos of large mask that actually only fits a 10yo child (seriously). It has been a ridiculous journey. NOT ANY MORE. I am ecstatic!<br /><br />This mask accommodates full facial hairs without the tightness (suffocation). The ear loops are adjustable to personalize fit for your features. The XL covers completely over the nose (bridge) to under the chin to the very edge of the neck (as shown in their photo). Breathable, 2-ply jersey without any unnatural smells (yeah, that was an issue with other brands earlier). The ""keeper strap"" is a welcome bonus. You can easily remove to eat or drink and it rest (front or back) around your neck.

121277,2.0,Leaking packaging AGAIN. New flavors disappointed.,I’ve used this brand since I found them on here but mainly just the peach mango because I didn’t like any of the old flavors. I was excited to see the new flavors but extremely disappointed in their taste. The mixed berry was the worst. It tastes like Unripe berries. It was not sweet at all. The tropical fruit was odd too. Peach Mango is still the only one worth buying in my opinion.. Not for $6 a piece though. We should be able to buy one for $3-$4 maybe. I also feel these last ones were not as sweet compared to my last purchase. Almost like they were watered down especially the mixed berry.  😔<br /><br />Oh and this is the second time in a row one of them was cracked during shipment. The subwoofer entire package was sticky and the bottles all sticky as well. Something is leaking somewhere.,121277

123345,5.0,Totally Awesome!,"1) When I use this with my shampoo, not only do I use less, but I feel like it totally gets my hairs cleaner. I try not to do too many small circles so I don't get my hairs tangled, use larger circles & then as its all lathered & With the circles in do do, I also use it like a wide tooth comb to essentially get any tangles out! Been working like a charm that way.<br />2) I have also been using this in the same way as the shampoo for my conditioner and it has been, I Believe, to be truely helping to get the conditioner further into my roots!<br />Now I don't have scientific proof its doing that... But in my heart & little pea brain lol, I'm hoping! 😁<br />3) Since my hair has been falling out from a hair dye it got off of eSalon, Don't Use Them IMHO because I have talked with many other women that this has happened too also, I have just started to use a Biotin hair formula to hopefully Help! Time will tell.<br />I really Don't know how my method would work for someone with very thick hair. 🤔<br />I hope this long winded review helps. 🙂<br />4) The facial scrubbers seriously work better than just using my fingers.<br />Thanks for reading. 😊",123345

They totally are a great addition to any party.<br /><br />Ok so they come (show in picture) you have to open them. They come with tiny paper clips (shown) but I used larger ones. 3 on each fan so I can reuse them again. I didn’t use the sticky tape that’s included on them. This package comes w/ 3 stars which I attached with Sticky Velcro dots (that I purchased at the .99 cent store, shown in picture). Also so I can remove them & reuse them.<br /><br />Ok so hanging them & keeping them reusable was difficult. I tried a lot of different things. The dowel thing, hanging them on pins through the middle hole, Velcro stickers on the back... none of them worked out 🤦🏻‍♀️<br />So they come with white string attached to them, that’s not the look I wanted but at midnight after trying several things, this was my only option & it worked!<br /><br />I added a pic of the final product, I tried to do it just like the pic. I hope this helps someone else in the future, you can barely see the string, and I hung them with pins not with thumbtacks so it’s less obvious (I tried both).",124746

They're over twice as expensive as one of the other brands I like for the same amount of bars and similar macro and carb counts.<br />** Edit - yikes what happened? Seems they're no longer selling the salted caramel and prices doubled?? I get there's inflation, but $50 for 12 bars 😬? I already thought they were expensive at $24.99.",124821

I have slept in these sleeves for a little over 2 weeks , when I awake my feet don't feel like I'm trying to stand up in bricks in my ankles..my guess is the bands/sleeves keep my toes straight and add support to my arches increasing the circulation. I suffer with diabetic neuropathy in my toes. I wear the bands when reclining in my chair as well with the same benefit.  I purchased the correct size that goes up to a woman's 10, but I think the next size will be better should I want to wear these sleeves in my shoes or under socks. My experience is they roll up in my shoes. Hope this lengthy testimony helps someone.😊",125791

There is a convenient sticker menu on the bottom listing by program # and its function and the top control panel u just push - or + button til u get the # and in 5 secs the generator will start and the display will show min/sec time remaining.  This is a nice small size but is NOT a quiet generator it IS VERY LOUD🔊, i dont like it, sounds like a motorboat🚤 in a fish🐟 tank.

127656,4.0,Best cleaner ever!,"I’ve been living in Japan since 2016, so when I came back and heard they stopped making the Cherry Blossom Pomegranate Lysol, I was upset. Pretty much everywhere you look, Cherry Blossom is everywhere in Japan. It’s very difficult trying to find anything Cherry Blossom scented in the United States. Even Japanese Cherry Blossom from BBW doesn’t really smell like Cherry Blossoms to me. I also love the Lilac scents that Glade, Mrs. Meyers, and Febreze have out. I don’t like that most floral scents have to be limited edition and seasonal scents. Great Value has a Japanese Cherry blossom spray that smells like cherry blossom 🌸 and similar to this cleaner. I doubt it’ll be our yearly, I’ve only seen it this Spring.<br /><br />I ordered 3 bottles of this spray and all were packaged very well.<br />However, unfortunately some had spilled into the box. All 3 were not completely filled and there was some cleaner spilled in the box. I paid $30 for 3 bottles…that’s $10 a bottle. I think it’s worth it being they don’t sell this anymore anywhere, but they aren’t full bottles.<br />The original bottles I had were full. I still have an old bottle from 2015 and it had more cleaner than these came with. I keep hoping they bring these back, but for now I’m just going to hope and pray my husband is okay with me spending $30 on these again when I run out. 😬<br />I’m going to add water to help make it last longer because the bottles arrived half empty. It could also be due to the spray nozzle and when you overfill them, it can cause spillage.<br />I haven’t used them yet, so I’ll measure them on a scale before I use them and take photos of how much is in the bottles. If I remember, I’ll post more photos when I do.<br />I may just have to place an order once a month so I can stock up on it. I’ll be using it often anyways. It smells exactly like the original one, so I believe it’s the real deal. I understand the price is only high because they don’t make it anymore.",127656

The quality was lacking as well, as many of the balloons lost all their air and shriveled up within the first hour!—but since the balloons are supposed to look pathetic, it didn’t bother us much.

What the heck??? I tried a different face wash hoping it might have just been the face wash. I don't think so. Had high hopes for this brush. After all it's just a spinning brush.

It did, but not 100%.<br />My symptoms were;<br />Wrinkled skin (not necessarily dry)<br />Brain fog<br />No sleep<br />Pressure in throat -not a sore throat, just a mild pressure<br />Joint pain that was wretched esp. In the AM.<br /><br />The coconut oil helped so much!  Won't be giving that up, but only for skin and some degree of the brain fog<br />Got a prescription for thyroid meds, but some of the effects one could experience made me keep looking to see if there was a better way.<br />Bought these pills and the pressure in my throat has reduced considerably.  I'm getting iodine drops to try one drop a day to see if I can get that completely gone.<br />So far no noticible help with joint pain, but it's only been 2weeks.  I started cherry fruit extract and that helped a lot!<br />Got butterbur for sleep... It's great!  I read the medical comunity believes Melatonin and Benadryl are a causes of dementia in old age with prolonged use.<br />Brain is back.  😳  That's a good thing!<br />I think it is sad that they charge $16.  I can't imagine it really has to cost this to make.",133640

135137,1.0,Made by Extraterrestrials For Female Extraterrestrial Parts.,"I never thought I would ever be writing a review for a pantiliner, but here I am 🤷‍♀️<br />I will say that these are absorbent with good adhesion. The quantity for the price is amazing. But that is the only good things I have to say.....I want to know EXACTLY what the heck the cover sheet is made of....it is shiney and feels like a sheet of plastic!! The black color is muted, with an almost greyish tone to it. And these seem to be the smallest liner ever made. I don't get it. Don't buy these, just don't do it. There are other options out there for cotton black liners, so just go that route. It's unfortunate that women have to pay such a high price for black, organic liners and I'll never really understand it myself. "" Pink tax"" anyone?♀️ I'll be heading my way over to another brand of black liner that I purchased, and love, to leave a review and draw attention to the ridiculous price.<br />As far as these liners go, I'm afraid to wear them, so in the bin they went 🗑. Please don't wear these ❌, I cannot see how they would be good for the v-jay. I mean, they are right up against it yes? Don't put anything synthetic against your v-jay! Don't even buy the big brands in pads and liners bc they are plain out toxic! Chlorine bleach whitened?! Against the v-jay?!<br />Organic cotton,period!<br />So- yeah-what EXACTLY  is this made from?? I couldn't figure it out and I tore one apart. I found some cotton in the middle. I have never seen a liner that looks like this. (Don't buy these)",135137
135138,3.0,OHHH NOOOOO WAYYYY!! WHAT IN THE HOLY HEAVENS?! NOT MEEEE! NOT TODAAAYYYY!,"What in the actual??!! I tried to love these, I really did. But NOOO WAAYYYYYYY!<br />Firstly, I'll say this-<br /> length=great.<br />Adhesive =great<br />Absorbency =great<br />Softness=great<br />Comfort=great<br />Shape=great<br />Price point=great<br />Scent=not so great<br />Plastic wrap= most definitely not so great<br />Sensation on the the v-jay, AWFUL!!!<br />What is supposed to be a cooling sensation turned into an uncomfortable,  almost burning feeling within no time!<br />I read reviews for a considerable amount of time, and it seems I am not alone in this sentiment.  The ""burning"" went on way longer then 1 or 2 minutes on my v-jay and never really stopped. It only be came less intense. I was well aware of my v-jay the entire time I wore this liner....YET I continued to wear these liners for 2 days....I digress 😑<br /><br />Maybe cucumber instead of mint for the ""cooling"" effect? The scent from these liners from the essential oils was very strong and lingering. My bathroom was filled with it, and guess what else was scented by it as well? YEP- my v-jay! UGHHHHHHH!  The combination of a scented v-jay and ESPECIALLY the constantly lit match stick in my undies was the the deal breaker! ( fire crotch comes to mind 🚫🆘️🔥☄)<br />On day 3, I threw in the towel....and the bag of liners- right in the bin! I can't do it!<br />For me, these liners smell awful and provide an over-the-top awareness of my v-jay, which I found awkward and unnecessary 😐 I love the whole mission behind The Honey Pot Company,  and if these liners ever become available with a different combination of herbs/essential oils I will be right back. But that mint and yucky rose essential oil which I've never liked (unpleasant smell to me) well, they can keep it! 💯😕🙄<br />I really wanted to be one of the reviewers that could wear these and love the essential oil scent and the sensation that comes from them. Unfortunately,  that was not the case for me. My v-jay can stay down there and not remind me constantly that it IS there 🤫 🤷‍♀️<br />You may have an entirely different experience with these liners, and 30 for 6 bucks and change isn't too hateful to give them a try. I ordered a few other brands of cotton/ organic liners, and I surely hope my holy grail will be found. These, however, are certainly not.",135138

137299,5.0,LOVE...Like Really...,"I am lucky to have fairly long lashes but I struggle with them being straight as an arrow.

Then enters this automatically heated curler 😍 What an amazing invention…I can’t believe I didn’t think of it myself! It heats to the perfect temperature not too hot or too cold, and it securely grabs the lashes with no pulling or pinching at the edges.<br /><br />With that you move it up the lash like you would a normal lash curler and you get this perfectly curved lash that looks absolutely amazing after adding some mascara. I couldn’t be more pleased and will absolutely use this on a daily basis. And yes, I threw my metal curler out the window never to be burned again. Would absolutely suggest this to anyone with lashes!",137299

140826,1.0,AVOID THIS PRODUCT - full of HIGHLY STAINING POWDER,"This is the most premium-priced turmeric - and its quality is SHODDY.  Two bottles IN A ROW I received had the exact same manufacturing defect:  EVERYTHING inside the bottle is coated in had bright yellow/orange powder that WILL BADLY STAIN anything it touches when it gets on your hands... clothes, towels, etc... and you won’t realize it until you’ve ruined your favorite shirt.  The manufacturer refuses to address this problem.  What made this all the more irritating is that Am*zon wouldn’t let me return both bottles to their return desk located in a store very close by that O was standing in.  They want to make me drive across town to return one of them.  AND after my and similar quality complaints about this product, they are still selling it to people!!  Obviously both the manufacturer and the seller are at fault here but neither cares.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Photos include TWO separate RECENT defective bottles of this product, and the indelible stain it left on my couch.  I should sue to have it cleaned or replaced.<br />UPDATE:  I complained directly to the manufacturer.  Their response was troubling.... they acknowledged knowing about this problem yet haven’t replaced Amazon’s inventory.  They promised to send me a “good” bottle without this defect.  Guess what.... it has the SAME PROBLEM!  FOUR BOTTLES IN A ROW have this virtual explosion of loose bright orange powder coating the EVERYTHING in the bottle!

I know the calm putty only changes purple in the fridge but how do you think mood rings and all of that change color?? With different body temperatures!! Come on people this is mainly for kids just like the “tooth fairy” yet I doubt you would give her such a bad review. Also the energize putty... I LOVE IT! It sparkles in the light and almost instantly I felt energized and very upbeat. Worth every penny and definitely helps with my fidgeting, ADD, OCD, calming me down, and helps me relax.<br /><br />Oh and to the person that said it’s too hard to play with... I’m a 106lbs female and my year and a half twins have NO problem squishing it around their little fingers! Maybe you should start looking into a gym membership. lol 😂 And No I have nothing to do with whoever makes this stuff I honestly don’t even know who does anyways and I’m not getting anything from writing this just figured I’d state a few facts for all the downers here.

146053,5.0,FINALLY!!!,"Got this curling brush/iron yesterday....I'm so happy I could cry! I'm a 70 year old just retired Barber so it's not like I don't have a crap load of styling tools...every size curling iron, curling/blow dryer brushes etc. I've been thinning out on my top for a few years and because I always had thick hair I was at a loss as to know what to do with it. I grew it into a bob right below my ears so that I could hide the thin parts on my head but my hair was always flat 😳! At one time I couldn't walk through the store without some one telling me how pretty my hair was, I miss that....but ...I think I'm going to be hearing that again! Played with it yesterday and got decent results with unwashed hair so today washed, conditioned, a bit of gel blow dried with my fingers so I looked like a wild woman and went to town with the new curling brush...Wow I'm back, volume for days, sprayed it with texture spray and worked it with my fingers...love this tool, don't hesitate to buy it...you won't be sorry!",146053

I do believe it'd be a very nice investment in terms of that there's no need to keep going to the faucet to get water and that an electric heating pad will just turn off after a certain amount of time...

146606,5.0,Cat's Eye Gel Set,"I love the cat's Eye Gel polish.  I would describe the colors as black, charcoal, mauve, purple, blue-gray, copper, and a grayish-brown.  The brown is not as brown as in the picture.  I don't know whish color is supposed to be the blue-gray color, but I may try it next.  It would look great with denims.  I like every color.<br /><br />I didn't take a picture of my nails because I am 71 years old and my hands are all wrinkled.  😁  But I like doing my own gel polish.<br /><br />This polish covers well in 2 coats.  Usually they say not to shake gel polish because it makes bubbles on the surface of the nail, but you must shake this polish very well because it had metal/glitter in it.  I think the magnet that makes the cat's Eye pulls the glitter toward the magnet to form the cat's eye?  Just my guess.  Anyway, I can't wait to change the color in 2 weeks.<br /><br />As far as durability, my nails are very hard after applying a base coat, two coats of color and a top coat.",146606

146920,4.0,Sceptical after looking in unit/hopeful it works,"The air cleaner looks modern/stylish. Its a little bulky length wise & I had to rotate & or switch it to the top plug or move the other things I had plugged into another location, but if these actually work as described then moving a few things around is well worth my effort. The thickness of the item still allows you to put things close to the walls if needed. My only concern is I read a review that stated thier unit caught on fire but I've checked both of mine several times & both are cool to the touch. I made sure to not put anything against or close to the units to be safe & also to assure the units can function properly. I purchased 2 for my room of 10ft×10ft b/c I read that one unit does the area of an average sized bathroom so I figured 2 would be perfect. I've been in this home for a month now & despite shampooing the carpets & vacuuming/ changing filters, I'm still having trouble breathing b/c the prior tenants had cats & from the amount of dust & dirt I suck up every time I vacuum I can tell they were not clean people. So I'm very hopeful that these air cleaners help me breathe better. After a month or so I'll update my review & let everyone know if there's been an improvement in air quality or if I just bought two expensive plastic boxes! *** I do wish the manufacturer offered a diagram or explained what is inside the unit that makes it function as described.** And it certainly would put me at ease & others from what I've read that we're not wasting our money on an empty box. 18$ each after tax is alot of money in my opinion to hope the manufacturer is selling/making a honest product. I tried to take some pictures of the inside b/c I see a tiny circuit board & a few wires to make the 2 green lights come on when plugged in. I see nothing inside that proves its working as advertised. I'm hoping I'm wrong & there's more working parts past that little circuit board. Fingers crossed!😣 Also I hear no sound at all. I think if this functions as described that I'd hear at least a faint noise of some kind!?!",146920
147062,5.0,"Best mask, so comfortable!","I have a very small nose bridge and I struggle with wearing masks. Unfortunately I work in a facility that requires mask wearing 💯 of the time.<br />Masks ride up into my eyes, don’t stay in place and are basically mashed up against my face at all times. Having to wear one all day also means my lips get really dry as I can’t apply lip balm as it will end up smeared all over my face.<br />These Henry masks have changed all that for me. The origami style keeps the mask off my face/mouth and because of the structure of the mask, it stays in place!!! They’re a little bulkier looking on the face but I really could care less, I LOVE this design. I love all the color choices and the QUALITY of these masks.",147062

These are small and way easier to swallow compared to others I’ve tried in the past. Also, there’s no overwhelming fishy smell when you open the bottle. I also haven’t had any of the dreaded fish burps(I don’t like fish at all). I love the fact that I can use this product for my inflammation issues, and my fiancée can get his blood pressure more manageable. Overall, I give this product 👍🏻👍🏻.

I'm not an insole junkie nor a connoisseur, but as you can see from the short clip, they seem about as memory foam as any others I've had in my shoes. I'm very happy with mine, though they are just for slippers, not all day wear.

153165,5.0,Excellent VG for DIY e-liquids,"Excellent, non GMO, kosher USP food grade VG. I use it for making my own  e-liquid (heretofore referred to simply as juice) and I couldn't ask for a better product. It's much less expensive than buying from a B&M vape shop (if they'll even sell it to you) or an online vape shop. I quit smoking cigarettes back in 2012 after I bought a cig-a-like from 7-11, it didn't produce much vapor, but it got me off the tobacco. I vape a lot and I've gone through a liter of VG every 3-4 months for use in my juice and that's only for my personal use. This VG is clear, slightly sweet, and highly viscous compared to propolyne glycol (PG), the other main component of most juices. PG is closer in viscosity to water, therefore it is used to thin out the mixture of your juice and give it more throat hit (TH makes juice comparable to a real cigarette). I personally don't use any PG in my e-liquid, because I don't care for any throat hit, I prefer a max VG juice because it's the ingredient that produces lots of vapor. If you are a vaper thinking of making your own juice I wouldn't hesitate to start because you'll save a lot of money and you can learn to make flavors that are specific to your preferred needs and taste. If you consider the low price of this VG, around $13.00 for a liter, plus the cost of flavoring, (and another necessary ingredient which is highly addictive), you'll be at about ¢35 for a 30ml bottle. Compare that to how much you pay for high quality (high percentage VG usually 80%) juice from a vape shop which on average is about $22.00 for 30ml bottle, and you'll see the savings on juice alone. Vaping is not cheap. Not for me anyway, however using products like this VG will definitely help you keep more money in your wallet and you'll feel the health benefits from quitting smoking 🚬. I was a pack a day smoker for thirty years. I only wish vaping would have been an option a long time ago. Now I have COPD and require oxygen. That's why I'm such a proponant of vaping or e-cigarettes (if you want to call it that) I don't like the term, it is too misleading but it's very recognizable. I will definitely recommend you buy your VG from this seller. It's a high quality product and I will be buying more in the near future. I hope this review is helpful and informative.",153165

I purchased it and we picked her up to take her to dinner. I showed it to her and she nearly threw the old hospital cane on the floor. She loves the beautiful stylish design of this cane. She is no longer depressed at the thought of using a cane!  I will buy her the lighter color version for summer. Thankyou so much for making such a beautiful product.

Short short battery life is the big downfall for this product. Disappointing.<br />**EDIT!! After a second charge - the battery lasted through 2 days of curling. I’m raising my rating from 3 star to 4 star. It leaves a nice soft curl. I would recommend this curler. Be very careful of how you hold it though - read the instructions and hints - your hair can tangle really fast if you start your curl in wrong.,157948

However, I was able to fit a bag of those mini snack variety packs and a few small candies inside. The bags are reusable so they can be used again for anything else. The string and pins are reusable too, which was also a plus. There was a set of the bag's design that I wasn't sure what the font on it said so I kept those two for myself. All the other designs were cute and perfect for Christmas! 🎄",160632

162902,5.0,Great for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis in their elbows,"I have have rheumatoid arthritis in both elbows (as well as wrists and hands). I ordered these because even with my gel elbow pads on my desk at work, my inflamed elbows were feeling a lot of pressure and tenderness. They're not the most stylish (wich sucks for me because I forget to take them off sometimes when I go somewhere... 😂), but they do provide a thick layer of cushion between your elbows and the desk surface. There are days when even touching my elbow is immensely painful, and these really help with that. The material is a little scratchy, but easily not an issue since the measure of relief more than makes up for it.  You can also move the padding around a little bit, to situate it more to one side or the other, depending on your pressure points or the angle.",162902

163750,5.0,Gives the BEST Nail Clipping experience for me. Here's why...,"After I spent months researching high-rated nail clippers to try after my old pair became useless and tore up my nail ends,  it was a toss up of this and another Japanese brand. The other failed my expectations, so I ordered this nail clipper to try next.<br />*** It was B.I.N.G.O.  at  1st trim 😂  ***<br />Here's why:<br />-  much less (if any) need to file nails after clipping with this brand<br />-  should some filing be needed, it's literally more like a touch-up, thus much faster task<br />-  the clipping mechanism is very smooth<br />-  it ""cuts like butter""  unlike the other brand I recently tried (and the old pair I had for years)<br />-  the size, shape, handle = the whole design is perfect to hold and very pleasant to use<br /><br />I'm so glad I didn't give up trying to find what works best for me!<br />Finally, no longer a dreaded task to file my nails with this Green Bell clipper.<br />Clipper keeps my nail in a good shape and nail ends smooth.<br /><br />Seriously, with other brands I've owned and tried, those nail clippers would get my nails out of  shape and leave the edges rough.  It was so time-consuming to fix both nail shape and repeatedly file those edges until my nails couldn't snag anything.<br /><br />FYI:  These are size small meant for finger nails.<br />- I did use it on my toe nails with equally good success.<br />- Depending on size, shape and thickness of your toe nails, you might want to invest in their larger size meant for toe nail clipping.<br /><br />Hope this review helped you.<br />Enjoy if you buy ;)",163750

They’ve been a hit! My daughter now enthusiastically brushed away all the colors, and I’ve even passed some out to my nieces and daughter’s friends, who all have had fun using them and asked for more. The only thing I’d say about these is get more if you can, because 50 isn’t enough. Kids want to keep using them and frankly, I’m not one to say no to hygiene enthusiasm 😂",166097

So Comfy! 🥰😷🥰,"Buttonsmith makes the BEST 100% cotton face masks and they are MADE IN THE UNITED STATES!<br />We especially appreciate the adjustable ear loops which also are part of a neck loop which keeps the mask from falling off and getting soiled! Ingenious design for starts, and the filter pocket is ample enough to hold thicker wider filters! This is our most comfortable and favorite face masks!

171784,1.0,Mask that’s not quite there yet.,"Reviewed in USA  22-Feb-2021<br />Item:<br />Buttonsmith Black Adult XL Cotton Adjustable Face Mask - Made in the USA<br /><br />PRO:  These Masks are: comfortable, soft and lightweight.  I am 6’1” tall and bought the XL size for myself and the L size for my wife.  The specifically signed masks fit both my wife and myself well, with good extension up the bridge of the nose, and extends well under the chin.  In addition the ear straps ARE ADJUSTABLE 😄.<br /><br />CONS:  And, in my opinion these con’s ARE SIGNIFICANT.<br /><br />1.  THERE IS NO metal or plastic strip at the top of the mask to make it conform to the bridge of the nose.<br /><br />2.  Without disassembling a mask, it appears  THERE ARE NOT 3 layers of fabric forming the face mask.  THERE APPEARS to be only TWO layers of fabric used in the mask assembly<br /><br />I believe that the available guidance from Dr. Fauci and CDC calls for 3 layers of material in the body of the mask.<br /><br />3.  The interior pocket for a filter covers the entire interior surface of the mask.  The here is no notification what size filter to use with the mask.  I am concerned that the PM2.5 filters would migrate within the pocket to a position where they would be ineffective.<br /><br />This final statement is going to sound snarky, for which I apologize in advance if is not called for, but I choose to wear face masks to protect myself as well as those whom I come into contact.  I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WEAR MASKS AS A FASHION STATEMENT.",171784

175592,1.0,Horrible taste. No idea what the good reviews are all about...,"Honestly, I don't want to give it one star. It tastes awful. I got banana cinnamon. It's very mild in flavor and you have to add to it to get it down. I really wanted to try this after reading the benefits of collagen so I read all the reviews and bought it. It's the worst shake I've ever tasted. I've added MORE cinnamon, MORE banana, and stevia which equals MORE calories but it still didn't taste good. I've taken to baking with it - that's a $70 baking product... 😳 I can't tell you about any benefits because I can't choke it down. For reference, the shakes I generally drink are Bodylogics and Ascent- both I love. This one was a big loser for me. Sorry!",175592

The large scratches are not as long as they were originally but they are definitely still noticeable and deep. I never expected this polishing system to to remove the deep scratches so I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I had enough polish and rubbing strips for 2-3 applications on an Apple Watch sized glass, so I’ll most likely try this on another watch. I only utilized the system one time.",177142
177180,5.0,My Go-To face mask,"Amazon sent me three of these as a free gift. I guess I spend so much money with them. 😂<br />Anyway, these are my go-to masks. Light, breathable, and I don’t get claustrophobic, which I do in the heavier ones. They wash nicely but I always wash my masks by hand and hang to dry. I’ve used my three over and over for about a month now, but you may want to always carry an extra because wearing for an extended period can cause excessive moister which will cause a breeding ground for bacteria. My husband learned the hard way by not changing his mask out at least every three hours throughout work and he got strep throat. His Dr said the masks are causing a lot of cases of strep, mouth sores and and acne. Also, rinse your mouth with mouthwash morning and night to help keep the bacteria down.<br />Sorry, got off course, but these fit my normal size head 😂. And my husband’s, who has a beard, comfortably. I’m ordering more right now.",177180

178587,3.0,"Works well, but is hard to use","My hair is curly everywhere except for the crown of my head, that is straight and because I have long layers, it covers most of the curls. I usually just straighten it all, but lately I've been wanting to wear it curly, so I thought I'd use a curling iron to make the curls I don't have naturally. When this arrived I was surprised that the &#34;clip&#34; that holds your hair in place while you curl it doesn't lift like a traditional curling iron, it slides back and forth against the barrel pinching your hair. It was difficult to use and took me an hour and a half to curl the top of my shoulder length hair 😞. However, after a lot of time and frustration, it did work really well, my hair looked great. It's just not practical for every day use, at least not for me.  (For those that said it only curls in one direction, you're right, but if you turn the curling iron upside down, that changes the direction of the curl 😉)",178587
178908,5.0,Kids use these on the daily,With masks being worn every time we go out my kids NEED these as well have yet to find masks small enough for them.

179109,3.0,Vitamin Enriched Vanilla Protein Shake - 😊👍,"I got to try out the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake vanilla flavor. This is made by Amazon Basic Care one of the Amazon brand of products. My son and I think they are fairly tasty. They taste as good as any other protein drink I have tried, even better than some. They taste very similar to Ensure vanilla protein shakes. They have 9 grams of protein and 26 vitamins and minerals per bottle. The only negatives I have worth noting are; the vitamins provide 25% of the RDA across the board; there is 15 grams of sugar per bottle; and there is 6 grams of fat. To me they taste good and maybe the sugar content has a lot to do with that too. I did check out Ensure vanilla and it too contains an awful lot of sugar coming in at 22 grams of sugar. If these are to be a cheaper alternative to Ensure, then why can I buy Ensure on the Subscribe and Save program and not these? After all these are an Amazon brand product. Maybe once these are available as a Subscribe and Save item, there will be more of a cost savings over the other guy.<br /><br />I give the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake ⭐⭐⭐. If you compare them to Ensure and they are to be a cheaper alternative, then they should be cheaper and be available as a S&S product!<br />I hope this proves helpful. Thanks for Reading - ✌😉",179109
179408,4.0,Wish I had found these years ago! Much easier cleanup…,"The only household chore that I really hate is cleaning the outside of toilets, especially the one on the 1st floor that everyone uses, including visitors.<br />(When you’re not the one who ever dirties it, cleaning it gets annoying!)<br /><br />I saw these disposable mats & knew I had to have them for the upcoming knee replacement surgery in the family.<br />It’s already a bit tricky to use the bathroom post-op, so why not make cleaning a bit easier?!<br /><br />And it is.<br />I covered the mat with a small rug to make it less obvious (a toilet rug would cover it even more, but I recently threw ours out after dozens of washings.)<br />It fits right up to the edge of the base to prevent buildup there.<br /><br />*NOTE* The 4 tape areas really should be bigger - they’re little strips that are sticky enough, but I would like either 7 of them (4 at the back & 3 across the front) or the existing areas should be a little bigger for a tighter fit.<br />—We have a Kohler one piece toilet for picture reference—<br />The plastic strip that you peel off to expose the tape ripped the corner on my 1st try, so peel slowly & carefully.<br /><br />I don’t detect much of a lavender scent so far, but maybe when they’re “activated” by more use, so to speak?!<br />I do recommend them for potty training or medical situations or even for everyday use if you hate cleaning toilet bases like I do.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!** 🚽",179408
179434,5.0,Good for light makeup removal,I have moved from using the regular colored microfiber pads to these types of bamboo pads for removing make up. The regular colored microfiber pads sometimes irritated my skin for some reason. I haven’t had that the same problem using bamboo pads. There’s remove a light amount of make up with no cleanser. However if you are a heavy make abuser you definitely want to use some type of cleanser when you use these pads. They wash and dry well with my regular towels I just put them in a delicates bag. I wouldn’t use fabric softener on these either.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful🙂,179434

183631,5.0,FIVE STARS!! Great suction power for a small device!,"Great product! I purchased this because of the size, price and figured I would give it a shot. This little device works about just as good as my $400 microdermabrasion machine and no I am not kidding.  I don't have to take out a heavy machine and clean it after which it a huge plus for me. The suction power surprisingly strong for such a small device. I have used it 3 times already and still have not needed to charge the battery yet. It has 3 suction setting and I prefer the highest setting. It come with one diamond coated tip attachment which is awesome. My recommendation to keep all your tips clean is to soak them in alcohol or witch hazel as you can see in my last picture this device sucks out quite a bit of debris out of your skin.. If you are on the fence about purchasing this product, give it a try. I am glad I did..<br /><br />Note for new users: Always remember to keep the moving at all times. Do not hold it in one spot otherwise you will end up with a small round hickey on your face like the other reviewer stated.

So it won’t be as smooth as others.<br />-<br />Service:<br />• AMAZING!!<br />• I could not take the sour taste, and tbh this one is pretty expensive! So I emailed l them and told them about it.

I enjoy having the feeling  of positive energy around me and these do the trick. Ty for the product. Update: Just received my other 6 generators today, and as the first 2 I had ordered earlier these also came almost perfect. On a couple of them just a wee little part was broke off of the tip of the generators, but no biggy, it just gives them character . They still give off the positive energy I was looking for.  These are very calming to be and to have around. I found when I have a hard time sleeping I would just put one near me, or under my pillow, it has a very calming effect on me.

190809,5.0,More Than Hair,"I have pets and when I learned how dangerous Lysol was to use around them I sought alternatives.<br />I found that SeaBreeze is incredibly effective as a surface cleaner. I have used it on bathroom surfaces, walls, even floors. Awesome! Mix with warm water as one would concentrated Lysol or even use it straight.<br /> I didn’t have to rinse when I used it on the walls and floors though I did dilute it. Just let the floors and walls air dry. As with all household cleaning products don’t let pets ingest, don’t use on pets (I wish I didn’t feel it necessary to say that), and don’t let them run up against wet surfaces.<br />Cleans, disinfects, and makes rooms smell marvelous (in my humble opinion).<br /><br />Blessings and Balance.

191859,1.0,BAD QUALITY,"I'd like to preface my review by stating that this product has yet to be used. My statement is solely based on what I see visually before me.<br /><br />1. The wood is split along the side and could catch onto something and break off.<br /><br />2. The brush is so poorly made that it looks like it was cut from A 3D printer and then assembled.<br /><br />3. The bristles are uneven and sloppily inserted into the brush.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't examine the product upon receiving it. Had I done that it would've been returned. I've had a fantastic one that I lost and wanted to give this one a try... disappointed😞",191859

The directions say to wet your toothbrush THEN dip in the powder. I didn't have any problems. This may be common sense,  but worth mentioning -  the jar mentions you should keep the jar to one user. In other words,  each family member should have their own jar. They also give you a spot to write your name on the jar. I love this product 💖",192530
192575,5.0,It Works! Prevents cuts on knees and ankles,"This is my first experience with an epilator and it works! It's very much like a hundred little tweezers all at once. It was not painful at all on my legs, but the bikini area was a different story. 😬<br />It does take more time than shaving or waxing and I think that a good razor and shave gel will still be my go-to routine for speed and overall smoothness.<br />I will definitely continue using this, in addition to my razor, around my knees and ankles. It's perfect and almost impossible to scrape those hard to shave irregular areas.<br />It's a nice little product. Works as described. Includes a charging cord, little cleaning brush and a razor head, too.<br />I like the pink.",192575
192706,5.0,Perfect match!,"I really like this dish soap dispenser so far. I like that the bottle is clear and even though it's not a glass container, it still looks like it, it's very strong and seems durable. I also like that the tube for the dispenser goes all the way to the bottom. The pump is soft and smooth. It dispenses a good amount of soap. Also, the sponge holder is exactly what I needed because I hate leaving the sponge in the sink and it makes it look neat. The stainless steel look goes perfectly with the sink faucet. 😍",192706
193061,5.0,Absolutely amazing.,"I bought this as a present for my husband after being at trading for a month; to say the least he was not enthused. I admit even I was a bit skeptical at first “How could a pillow honestly make sex better?” But wow, I mean seriously WOW. We reach for this pillow almost every night. Now to the pillow itself, I was worried being a “well rounded” woman (hips, butt, thighs) I roughly wear a 12-14 size jean that the pillow would be too small, but it was perfect and honestly I could see women larger than me being just fine with it. It is very firm and also comes with a water proof case and almost a microsuede so no slipping or sliding 😉. Also I wanted to add that mine did come with a diagram of positions to try, although I think a Little karma sutra booklet including the pillow would’ve been the cherry on top. Overall a definite must to spice up any relationship.",193061
193224,3.0,Stopped working.,"One of the little comb bristles came broken right out of the package, but I gave it a shot anyway. The first couple of uses, I thought I lived this thing!

So sad it doesn’t work anymore. 😕",193224

Excellent option to come to Amazon - I don't know how they did it, but they got something right 👍 the stores are still behaving like they're still in the pandemic, can't count on the stores for traditional, regular products. If it works don't change it! Regular Woolite has always worked and I am happy with it! You can even use it for other gentle fabrics like couches, rugs, spot cleaning!

195640,5.0,Wonderful scent & even better cleaner!,"I had purchased this cleaner after going to my first yoga class & having multiple ladies step on my personal mat with their bare feet...(to me that’s a big no-no unless you’ve given permission 🤷🏻‍♀️) I was so shocked that I just rolled my mat up without using the shops cleaner & got out of there. Well I had realized when I got home that I ran out of the cleaner I had 🤦🏻‍♀️ Well I was SO happy to get this one in the mail- let me tell you!!! My mat smelled like new after the first wipe down! The scent was a fresh citrus & I was a tad worried about it being overwhelming on my mat afterwards when I practice- but NOPE that wasn’t the case! After it had dried you just got the slightest hint of clean citrus. Heck yeah! It in no way smelled chemically, which made me feel great about using it. I am exceedingly pleased with this cleaner & am definitely thinking of getting some of the other scents as well! Highly recommended!",195640

They're also about half as scented as the Lush bombs, which is fine with me; it's not so overpowering. We've used 5 or 6 and so far no tub stains. 👍  If you're a once-a-month soaker you can probably afford the expensive bombs, but then again, you probably wouldn't be looking to buy in bulk. If the bath is central to your life, (I know you: fantasizing about a big hot bath by 10 am, it's actually how you get out of bed on Monday, be honest)-these are for you.",198020

201884,5.0,Built Solid,"I just started using this today so it’s early on.  The cup is built well.  It feels heavier than my Blender Bottle.<br /><br />I can’t speak to durability yet, but of it fails, I will update my review.  I have concerns with the longevity of the locking flaps but they state they are well built and will hold up.  If not, they will take care of it.<br /><br />The opening tabs lock back so you don’t have to hold them as you drink.  Well done.<br /><br />The grid seems to mix the product well versus the metal ball.  I little bit more to clean as it can clump on the grid but that happens with the metal ball as well.<br /><br />So far, I’m really digging this one.  💯",201884

Nothing provided all-day, sweat-proof protection, which is pretty embarrassing and uncomfortable.  This product is the very first and the only thing I have ever tried that ACTUALLY WORKS. The vinegary smell disappates quickly, leaving you with shoes that don't stink. And the lack of stench LASTS! :-) This is probably the best product I have ever bought from Amazon.

I recommend if you're looking to brighten 🌞 your smile 😊😁 and FAST!!<br /><br />First of all, it's a great price for receiving 4 whitening sticks!! Ontop of that they actually WORK. MY teeth are nice, but due to poor dental hygiene , my front two and bottom few were starting to turn black around my gums, and like tan colored around the creases of my teeth 🦷. I brushed them twice before applying one coat of this gel. The brushing didn't do much , when I applied the gel in the areas that were dark it literally started disappearing, turning white 🤍. I was shocked. I didn't expect it to work, let alone so quickly. I finished putting it on my other teeth and then rinsed after allowing the gel to settle... My smile was brighter than ever!! I am now on Day 2 and going to be applying more of this stuff on my teeth & discolored ones to see the change!! Great!!",204263

205487,5.0,ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS MASK...,"I have every shape and every color mask...for style & for safety...I found this mask watching Housewives of Atlanta!!  Kandi had it on.  I took a screenshot of the brand and ordered it right away.  Price was higher then any I have but I am so sick of my glasses fogging up and the CONSTANT rearranging, repeating myself, not able to even wear lipgloss...just everything.  What a PIA they all were.  This mask was instant comfort. NO FOGGY GLASSES. NO REARRANGING, NONE.  It doesn’t move. IT IS AWESOME.  Everyone, everywhere I go...stops to ask me where I found it. I get compliments  constantly.  Especially about how nice and how neat it lays on the face.  Not sloppy.  I don’t feel I need to wear another mask with this one. It hugs my face all the way around my nose, cheeks and mouth. Perfectly.  I can breathe and talk with no problems at all.  It doesn’t come near my lips or my nose so it makes it comfortable wearing it long term. Hand washing masks after every use has become a habit already so no biggie there.  I tell everyone the brand!!  HENRY is so easy to remember now!!  I highly recommend this mask!!  Hands down...I love it!!  I feel totally protected!! 😊 I hope this helps!!",205487

Upon receipt it looks like an excellent dish wand - rather thick sponges that clip on well and also absorb the soap for a good clean the first time.",211933

212862,3.0,Not pain but tedious process,"Using this whitening kit is a little tedious because molds are large and cause your mouth to salivate, then the gel from molds get mixed with saliva. Then you have to put the light against your teeth and hold it with your lips which further increases salivating 😑 I honestly think the gel gets diluted with all that saliva and have a hard time telling is there any difference. My teeth are sensitive and I usually have to deal with pain when using whitening kits but this one wasn’t painful at all.",212862
212863,2.0,No foam - under average quality,"I’m not too crazy about these bath sponges. The scrubbing part is similar to used up sanding paper. The spongy part is VERY DENSE, no matter how much soap I pour in, I can’t get it to foam up like my loofah or my other bath sponge. Yes I add water 🙄 but I just can’t get that foaming effect. Lastly, chunk of scrubbing part tore AND the top nearly completely separated from the rest of the sponge. 3 uses only!  I would only get this at a dollar store, because, well it’s a dollar store and you can’t expect much for $1.",212863
212868,5.0,Practical way to add protein to your diet (or your kids),"This protein powder has a consistency similar to almond flour. It dissolves quickly and completely, does not lump up at all. I mixed it with water and it’s practically flavorless. I mean, I can “taste” little something but it’s like a different tastes of water. I am adding to cookies and most of our food because my boy doesn’t want meat or beans so this is a good protein addition to his diet without fighting at a dining table. I am very happy with this product. I received this free of charge for the review but will definitely continue to buy. If this is offered on Amazon subscribe and save I will definitely add to my subscriptions. 👍",212868

214389,1.0,I think the formula changed,"Pines used to be the BEST brand of powdered wheat grass and I never minded paying a little extra for it, however, this last bottle received delivers different news......the formula has changed.  😞 It no longer dissolves in liquid like it used to no matter how much it is stirred or how long it sits....I know it's not supposed to be delicious, I get that as a long time user, however, the new grittiness that doesn't dissolve now makes me gag. It make me suspicious what is in it that doesn't dissolve like it used to! And yes, I am storing it properly. So disappointing and I will go back to the other popular brand sold on Amazon as that is a smoother shot of daily goodness. Pines, in my opinion, not worth the $.",214389

214676,1.0,Not a great alternative,"I thought I would save $14 by buying this off-brand but its not worth the nicks on my face 😧. The foil does not cover the width of the shaver as well as the OEM and probably contributes to that. It also takes a bit of adjusting to fit properly (see video). I did not have to fuss with the OEM. Plastic parts where the OEM are metal, I can overlook. Stick with the Braun replacement, not this.",214676

214916,5.0,It’s awesome!,"I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER! This was exactly what I was looking for. I used to have a hair straightener for years that was covered in teflon fiber cloth and when it finally died after ~10 years I was sad to find out that the manufacturer stopped making it! I could not find another one like it anywhere...until now! These straighteners protect the hair more than normal from the damage that regular straighteners usually cause. With my old one, I would use it every day and every time I went to a hair salon the stylist could never believe that I used it because they always said how healthy my hair was. I bought two of these just to have a back up in case the manufacturer ever stops making them 😝",214916

219514,1.0,Defective product; return at your own expense,"So disappointed. 🙁My favorite natural fabric softener, Vaska, is no longer available so I searched for a new one. I should have looked at the return policy for this; my fault. I purchased this Sept 8 and it expires in 2 months. Maybe no biggie for a family of 5, but as a family of one, it takes me a long time to go through. However, the product, IMO, is defective. It’s as thick as sour cream. Won’t pour and I can see this clogging up my dispenser. Also, nothing about this smells natural. Smells like headache inducing commercial, chemical fabric softener. Not lavender like Vaska.  I asked to return it as defective, and while the seller agreed to take it back which was kind, I have to pay return shipping. I already paid nearly $20( product, shipping and tax even w/ Prime) and now I have to pay return shipping. And at 40.5oz this will probably be $5-10 to return. What a waste. Going in the garbage and I will keep searching.",219514

220717,4.0,"Huge, Heavy but all in one","Great storage case<br /><br />Cons:<br />It’s huge!  That makes it heavy and awkward.  My plan was to keep it in the kitchen cabinet but it has to sit on the top of my vanity now.<br /><br />The zipper is great but seems like with constant use it will break, but mine will be sitting on the top of my vanity unzipped normally.<br /><br />As others stated, you can’t easily fit 104 bottles in there.  Though that’s okay bc I leave spaces here and there anyway.<br /><br />You can’t use the pouches on the top of you use roller bottles in the holes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It’s huge!<br /><br />Good sized holes, slightly tight for 15mL bottles, not crazy loose for 5mL bottles.<br /><br />Love all my main bottles to be in one spot.<br /><br />I would love to have this as my new storage case once I start to sell more. Having them enclosed and labeled in one easy to inventory space 👍🏼.<br /><br />What I would change...<br />Slightly, very slightly taller size<br /><br />Mesh pouches, so I can see what’s inside of these very tall/deep pockets/pouches<br /><br />Maybe a stackable version that is half the width.<br /><br />Overall it is great.

I do not recommend keeping on for long periods of time, as they can be difficult to get off, for example, putting it on your arm At 8pm and then go to bed at 10 and wake up at 8am.

232672,5.0,Works as expected but not an easy job,"My Seiko solar watch is only 4 years old but started stopping every night. I tried charging the battery by placing it in the window but it would only work for 2 days without stopping. I installed the new battery this morning and have it in the window to make sure it’s fully charged before wearing. The installation of the battery was definitely challenging. I ordered a watch repair kit to remove the back and the tiny little screw that holds the battery in. When I say tiny screw I mean it’s a tiny screw. I removed the screw without much problem but screwing it back in was not easy to say the least. You really need one of the jewelers magnifying lenses that goes on your head to get the screw into the hole and screwed down. While holding the screw with the tweezers provided in the repair kit and trying to get it in the hole, the screw popped out and flew off the table. I can’t believe I was able to find it both times. So to make a long story short, this battery plus the repair kit will repair your watch but you need good light, good eyes, patience  and a steady hand. I really had none of the above but somehow managed to complete the job. Good luck 😁<br /><br />Update: the battery was not the problem as the watch still stops. 4 years of easy use and a 3 year warranty the watch is done. I had a Seiko before this one that I wore for 25 years. I have always swore by Seiko but have now ordered a Citizen.",232672

This cuff is much more manageable than others which makes it easier to take your own blood pressure. Others I tried had a bulky cuff that was a two man operation.<br />👍 USB or 4 AA battery (not included) powered.<br />👍 User data can be stored on the unit (only if you have batteries installed).<br />👍 LED screen glows green, yellow, or red depending on your reading. This gives quick feedback and helps eliminate misreading.<br />👍 No annoying voice instructions to turn off.<br />👍 In general this unit, though plastic, has a more quality feel than other similarly priced blood pressure monitors that I've tried.<br /><br />What I Wish Was A Little Different:<br />👎 USB-C would be simpler to plug in than the micro-USB. Older users may struggle to get the micro-USB plug turned the right direction.<br />👎 Bag is functional but feels cheap.<br />👎 It would be nice if batteries, even cheap ones, and a USB power transformer  were included. Even. in this day and age many older, non-cellphone users do not have USBs to plug into.",235578

235613,5.0,Amazing product that's working for me!,"I just wanted to say how. I really didn't think this was going to work, I thought it was a gimmick. I am blown away, and absolutely wonderfully surprised by how fast this started to change my dental health, and the overall effectiveness of this product. I've only been taking it for about 3 weeks and the noticeable, and dramatic difference happened within the first week and just gets better, and better. Like many of us, I had put off my dental health because finances have been tight the last couple of years and I was getting very concerned about the thinning of my enamel. I have a chipped front tooth on the bottom and that was getting worse, and the bleeding and overall sensitivity of my gums and my teeth was starting to  concern me<br /> After taking this product for a week, I noticed an instant reduction in the bleeding on my gums and the teeth sensitivity. Within the last week. I can absolutely notice a huge difference in my tooth enamel and it has thickened up already. I didn't even know that was a possibility, you can tell by my bite, and even my chipped lower front tooth has grown back part of where it was chipped. WHAT??😱 I did not know that was a possibility either. My teeth look whiter, my gums look healthier, and overall the foods that I was thinking I might not be able to enjoy eating anymore, that is totally out the window and I have no tooth sensitivity whatsoever at this point. I do just want to mention as well that I have Lupus, the worst form of Lupus and so I've had many issues with my mouth, and this I could not recommend more highly. If you're in doubt get it, it's very inexpensive. Just try it. I'm giving it to everybody I know cuz I think it's one of the best things I've come across in a VERY long time.",235613

But they do seem to be working its been a few weeks and I notice a big difference already! Just have to be consistent with it. I use them every night & sometimes during the day if I have time. You HAVE to use some type of oil or lotion while doing it! Or use it gonna hurt. The facial ones work extremely well too! I'm satisfied😊",237075

239276,5.0,It's a great female dog wrap,"It's a great female dog wrap. I have a small 4lb Yorkie and I bought the 9in waist. I should have bought the 7in and it would have been the perfect fit however since I have a chiwawa too I kept the bigger size. The best thing about it is the rope around the waist allows u to tighten as needed so even though it was a bit lose, after placing a pad inside and tightening it it still fit my Yorkie. All in all a great buy. You can rehash them. I washed them solo but they do release color. Be careful washing them with other items because it will be like placing a pink sock into a white load😂",239276

We have 3 medium sized dogs and when they run through the house it stirs up hair and dirt they've tracked in. The dust consistently settles on everything. Since I got this in January I went from dusting about once a day to once a week! My husband and I both breathe better. I love the noise level, I have a consist ringing in my ears and the sound helps drown that out. I've noticed the dogs are more relaxed when it's running too. Definitely worth every penny 👌",241476

243672,5.0,Nice brush,"This brush is really well made. I think the company owner chose a really nice pairing of handle and good quality Badger hair. Not the best Badger hair but intentionally chosen to keep the cost and quality in line. Very well done in choices of materials. More than this though, the owner makes it abundantly clear he believes in a hands on company providing the best service he can. I believe it too.<br /><br />Very nice brush. Comes in a great little box with plastic netting to keep the brush all together. The handle is a plastic or composite material. I really like that. I have a brush with a wood handle that I didn't hang on a rack. The paint on the handle exfoliated and the handle separated from the brush. I sanded the handle and coated it with a two part epoxy. After that, I epoxied the handle back onto the brush. It's bulletproof.<br /><br />Here, the Latherwhip guy took all that into consideration and manufactured a really great brush that should withstand even me😬.",243672

243803,3.0,Just wish I had bought another one with buttons,"Pros:<br />-Great white noise options and light combined into one device with the option to be portable which is what I was looking for.<br />Cons:<br />-Whyyyyyyy can't there just be buttons to operate the light as well as the sound? Why does it have to be an invisible ring??? Even after I finally understand how it works, it takes me multiple times to touch it just right. Extremely frustrating when you're trying to hurry and dim the light because you're trying to keep your twin babies asleep 🙄 And forget trying to explain to my husband how it works.<br />-Also, I wish you could dim it even more. I have to cover the light at night to be able to sleep, but still have some light.",243803

245328,5.0,Awesome diffuser!,"I am on a diffuser kick lately and purchased a few different ones for various rooms throughout my house. I had this one saved in my shopping cart and was hesitant because it was one of the more expensive diffusers on Amazon. Then one lucky day this little gem was a lightening deal and I had to grab it. I ended up getting two for the price of one which is amazing but I totally understand why this one is more expensive than others. I am now the proud owner of 2 of these (black &amp; white), a slightly less expensive ceramic diffuser, and a basic $20 unit. This one is in my kitchen currently and it by far performs the best out of the 3. Don't get me wrong all of the diffusers I've purchased are awesome and do the job but this one is amazing. I did think this was going to be a little larger based on the price but I still think it's worth it. 👍👍👍",245328

246772,1.0,The end of iron burns my fingers!,"The iron is nice and it heats up very well, but I can't count how many times I scorched my fingers.😐 There is a glove that is included, but it is oversized and to big for smaller hands. I prefer an iron that can be used without burning your gloveless hands. Seriously, I can't be the only one that gets annoyed wearing a glove while curling the hair.? The box only includes one glove so if you have to use your other hand during curling you will burn your fingers. The iron is longer in size and my hair is just shoulder length, so I ended up dropping the iron while curling my hair and then catching it with my opposite bare hand.<br /> As I mentioned, the iron is nice and I would probably rate 5 stars if it wasn't for the burns. I would definitely think about ordering an updated version with a cool end to the iron.",246772
246822,5.0,Good product but runs a little small!,I bough this for my teenage daughter. She’s haunched over a computer 6+ hrs a day in zoom classes and doing homework. Her posture was getting atrocious and she was complaining of back pain. We tried two other back braces before we decided on this one. She likes it because it’s not too bulky and can be worn comfortably and discreetly under her shirt. It does seem to run a little small. She has a 32 inch waist but the medium was way too tight and we had to return it for a large. It’s helping with her back pain and there is a noticeable difference in her posture.  My son has “video game posture” so he may be getting one next. 😁,246822
246825,1.0,(not so) nice! EDITED,"so far so good! the air pump is pretty powerful. it does not stand upright without being tied down the weight is lopsided. I'll be using it outside so thats not an issue.  I will update my review after Christmas🎄<br /><br />EDIT:  a few things:<br />pros: cute<br /><br />cons:<br />- most importantly the motor failed after less than a month. I have 5 other inflatables from laChamps. and another purchased this year that finished this Christmas like champs. this one started tripping my breaker then stopped working.<br />- the instructions say to tie it down in an X pattern, there's not enough rope to do that. had to use my own rope.<br />-started to mildew! gross. none of my other ones have any mildew.<br />- not bright at all. I had to shine a spotlight on it. to give credit though, I guess this is industry standard to put the cheapest led lights in inflatables because 3 out of 6 of my inflatables have weak lights.<br />- slow to fill and then I had to stand around in freezing temps to make sure it stood upright (it never did).<br /><br />all in all bad purchase. frustrating and then it died.",246825

247282,2.0,Update,these are amazing clippers for the price. I have a schnauzer I groom myself every month or so. The clipper still has almost 80% charge. Very silent so it doesn't get my dog anxious. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the packaging was very flimsy and for some reason I think its going to die after a year or less.

249245,4.0,Novel kind of slap bracelets.,"I bought these for birthday favor bags. They come in four patterns: 😍 😘 😂 😉 I like how they are much sturdier than regular slap bracelets. They seem to have the same kind of metal band inside as regular slap bracelets, but they’re coated with a thick silicone instead of a thin plastic tube. The only problem is that they smelly really terrible right out of the bag! It smells like a chemically paint odor. I still recommend getting these if you have time to keep them out of the bag for a few days so the odor disappears.",249245

Never buy anything without reviews!)<br /><br />With all that being said, I'm not a reviewer but if I were I would totally give the Apalus Straightener Brush a thumbs up and a 4-4.5 star rating. It does exactly what it says it will do.<br /><br />•It straightens your hair.<br /><br />•It has a power button and two temperature control button settings that go up and down in temperature.<br /><br />•It can go as high as 450 degrees.<br />Being my hair is so damaged from this last go around trying to get my hair lightened to go grey. I started at 390 and quickly set it down on 360. I still think this is too high. I have seen the review videos on YouTube and did my research before I purchased this. The ratings on Amazon where phenomenal. I don't purchase anything without a 4 star or above rating usually.<br /><br />•out of 1835 reviews, it rated 3.7 out of 4 stars. That was good enough for me out of that many reviews.<br /><br />•It comes in two colors pink/ black and black/ teal (picture below).<br /><br />•it has a swivel cord so no tangled cords and the cord is long.<br /><br />•it is definitely made for all types of hair. I watch several videos on all sorts of hair textures and ethnicities and actually thought &#34;this might be too hot for my hair&#34; because I'm Caucasian and have fine, damaged hair. But with the temperature control it works just fine.<br /><br />Cons or possible cons:<br />•it doesn't straighten your hair like a flat iron because it doesn't flatten the hair. It still gives you body and makes your hair feel full not flat but It gives you that straight look that you are looking. If you are wanting the flat iron straight look this isn't for you. But for the price of 29.99 it was totally worth adding to my collection for those days I don't want to curl my hair or straighten it.<br /><br />•in order to get the results that you want you will have to section off the hair. When you do this, it gets pretty darn close to the skin/ root without burning your skin because the rubber nobs don't get hot.<br /><br />•straighten the hair first from underneath the strand for a fuller look and for the brush to come in contact with all strands of hair. It won't come in contact with all of the hair if you use it like a regular brush.<br /><br />•it's kind of heavy, but my arm didn't get tired of using it. Although, it's easy to clonk yourself upside the head with so be careful.<br /><br />• my biggest con with this is that the back of the brush gets extremely hot. I usually put my pointer finger on the back of my brush or curling iron to guide it but quickly learned to grab somewhere else. 😉<br /><br />• the little rubber nobs on the ends of the &#34;bristles&#34; of the brush does pull a little but not to the point where it kept me from using it. (We will see how this works out).",249487

I feel like I have the mental clarity I had over 30 years ago! There aren't enough stars to rate this product properly. I plan to take this for the rest of my life! I drink it straight, and find it delicious.  I take a teaspoon daily.  Love, love, love it!!! 😍",249710
249719,2.0,"Very hot, no longer cools - definitely doesn’t freeze!","The original formula brought a cooling sensation and helped my pain, and I preferred it over BioFreeze. This new formulation burns my skin, but doesn’t do much for the pain. There is an uncomfortable burning that seems to just be skin deep, but there is no penetrating warmth or cooling.  Actually, there is no cooling sensation at all. It should not have Freeze in the name. Zim’s Unpleasant Surface Burn is more accurate. I’ve since begun using BioFreeze Professional. I recommend trying that if you don’t like this new formulation. However, if you like hot muscle ointments, then this one stings more than Tiger Balm Red 🔥",249719

249976,1.0,AWFUL,The smell is so bad! It is a sin to call the fragrance “sweet grace”. It’s hard to describe; old lady bad perfume; a strong chemical smell that will induce a migraine. 🤮 I got it right from their website…the smaller size is $9 but then you have to pay $8 in shipping! 🙄 rip off! I used it once and threw it out that’s how bad it was! DO NOT RECOMMEND! I’ve read the reviews before purchasing too! I can’t believe how many people “love” the scent! 🤷🏼‍♀️💩,249976
250088,5.0,Skincare Must-Have! Great for using while removing unwanted facial hair!,"I received this pre-wash dry brush as a gift. At first I was confused about how to use it and why?<br /><br />But let me tell you that the results speak for themselves!! Excellent tool for loosening up dirt, debris & dead skin cells prior to washing my face! I was amazed! I have a lot of dry, red patches on my face from sun damage. This tool really helped loosen up and remove all the dead skin cells! Which has greatly improved the look of my skin overall and helped reduce the red areas!!<br />PSA: WEAR SUNSCREEN DAILY! It's been one of my biggest mistakes!!😭<br /><br />On the evening prior to my 41st birthday I decided to pluck away some unwanted facial hair that was growing on the sides of my cheekbones. This dry brush was a huge help!! It helped clear the area, so to speak, so I could get better results as I plucked & tweezed away! I used it often to clear away plucked hairs and it made the process much easier! I was blown away by the results! My skin was so soft & smooth afterwards!<br /><br />On my birthday, my bestie stopped by to drop off gifts. She's an early bird and woke me up 😅 Afterwards, she called me and told me how great I looked! I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE COMPLIMENT! (Especially since I had literally just woken up!)<br /><br />I simply LOVE this dry brush from Pacifica! Great brand with a lot of high-quality products that are great for you, never tested on animals & vegan!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",250088

Package arrived on time and I was so happy not one of them was broken or cracked! Whoever packaged these does a great job the were all tapped together then shrink wrapped with a stronger plastic casing. I’m not one to leave reviews but I love this product and have been using it for maybe 10 years now and is normally priced like $20-25 per 16oz bottle anywhere you can find it in store and even online but I’m glad I looked for the deals and found 8 for $78! That’s less than 10$ per bottle! Amazing deal! Arrived fast and just in time for me to spoil a bunch of women with such a nice hair mask that last 6 months easy with weekly hair treatments!<br />The bottle does look different than this but I think it’s just the newer or older bottle style. Same product and same amount. 👍🏼,252791

256314,5.0,Best dry shampoo says this non-dude!,"You don’t have to be a dude to make great use of this product! I’m female and don’t use it for what it’s intended for, and it’s become one of my favorite products. I use it as a dry shampoo. I have oily hair, but it’s also thick and takes forever to dry so I wash it every other day. On the days when I don’t wash it, I need a product to keep the oilies away. I’ve tried dry shampoos in aerosol cans but they are so heavily perfumed that I can’t stand them. They also leave a noticeable haze in my dark brunette hair, especially near the scalp and part line. I’ve also tried baby powder, but again the fragrance is too overwhelming and I don’t care to smell like a baby who just had her diaper changed! For awhile I was just using plain old cornstarch but it was messy to apply and also left a white haze near my scalp.<br /><br />I ordered Fromonda because it’s one of the only unscented body powders I could find. And the verdict? I finally found my go-to dry shampoo!  It really is unscented, the shaker bottle makes it really easy to apply close to my scalp and roots, and it is very, very blendable! Meaning that I can easily rub it into my dark hair and it seems to disappear without leaving a noticeable white haze like other powders do. This powder seems to be finer than other powders which makes it easier for my hair to absorb. But also finer as in... hey girl, your hair is so fine and non-oily. How ‘bout a date?<br /><br />I also started using this powder as a primer before applying deodorant as it ensures my pits are dry first. I couldn’t get away with using it as a deodorant alone though, but I also think my pits are swampier than most! 😝",256314

263672,5.0,Really Helps,My daughter tried this and recommended it to me.  We live in dry and dusty Arizona so struggle with allergies and stuffy noses.  I have tried this for a few weeks as have they and it helps so much. After years of trying over the counter products or prescriptions we are not using those any more and have great benefit from ION Sinus.  😊,263672
263750,3.0,Cheap alternative to Foreo,"I bought this toothbrush because I love the silicone toothbrushes and have been really wanting to try the Foreo electric toothbrushes but didn’t want to buy a crazy expensive brush.<br />I really wanted to like this brush but the bristles are just too large to get a proper cleaning. The bristles do not slide under the gums like a normal toothbrush so if you have heavy plaque buildup this brush is not for you. Also didn’t like that my toothpaste didn’t last as long as it just vibrated away to nothing so I used this toothbrush without the vibration function which defeats the whole purpose of being electric.<br />But! This toothbrush is perfect for those that need gum stimulation and that’s about it.<br />I purchased this product with a coupon so almost got about half off, really glad because I opted to use my old manual toothbrush since it leaves my teeth feeling pearly and smooth 😉",263750
263886,5.0,Five Stars,😀,263886
263899,3.0,Good and Functional but not impressive,"Not bad for the price but dont expect to getting apple watch quality. The watch looks pretty good when wearing It and fits any attire whether It be casual, sporty gym clothes or business casual. I've worn It to job interviews and to a wedding, it fits anything unlike some of my other watches which look inappropriate for certain things. It performs the basic smartwatch functions but much more bland and unimpressive. The  screen quality is pretty disappointing as many of us are used to clear, high resolution screens with crisp vibrant colors of smartphone's and tablets, none of which is found here. The app you need to download to get message alerts and things like that is not very functional most times and you can tell that no development is put into it so don't expect any updates or things to get better for this app. Camera is useless, it might as well not exist. But to have a working smart watch that can receive calls, texts, play music, and browse the web like an old Nokia I'd say it's worth it but not if you want a real high quality, cutting edge smart watch.<br /><br />If I lost my phone and desperately need a replacement with only a few bucks to my name.. I'd buy one of these in a heartbeat and use it as my phone.<br /><br />This watch is a great inexpensive gift to give... it was a godsend last Christmas, I bought like 10 and gave em as gifts, they were a hit! This saved me hundreds of dollars that i expected to spend on gifts and the headache of thinking of what to get people. Not to mention most people think I spent an arm and a leg on their presents heheh 😉",263899

264099,5.0,Incredibly Great Product,"The next best thing since sliced bread. I have tried several calluses removers over the years and I get a pedicure twice a month, but this works wonders on my feet. It worked so great I used it on my daughter feet as well. My feet feel and look amazing 🤩  It was easy to use and it is very sanitary, because you are able to use a new pad each time. I absolutely love it and I recommend this. I’m not getting anything in return for my review, I was told this was a excellent product from an ex coworker on Facebook. I bought it and tried it and now I’m a huge fan👍🏽👍🏽🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏽👏🏽",264099

264799,5.0,My oh my!! The sheets don’t Lie!!,I was researching Amazon for a new foot decruster because my feet in between pedicures felt like jagged glass.. my feet would be pulling fibers from the sheets!!<br /><br />They were terribly crusty because my nail salon would use the cheese 🧀  grater on my calluses and the pumice stone in the shower just made me use up all my energy.. so upon reading reviews on here I said why not give this a shot..<br /><br />Im so glad I did!! This is so easy to use!! I used one hand to grip the callus remover-  it was that simple! Propped up one foot at time and went to town!! In less then three minutes I buffed off the dead skin and my feet felt like A STICK OF BUTTER!! 🧈 Just slidddding<br />All over my sheets!! I thought there was no way it would last until the next day and sure enough it’s day two and my feet feel better than what any $66 dollar pedicure out there could do!! And I spent $7 dollars!! $7!!<br /><br />So YASSSS this was an amazing investment and now hopefully I can keep them this way! No more breaking bricks like I’m Jackie Chan - woop woop 🙌🏽<br /><br />The one thing I would say- before you go all crazy on yourself is to put a few days in between you and your new buff daddy.. so that new skin can regenerate! Or you can buff out too many layers making the skin tender (and even feel some what raw). Just a little advice for all the crusty toe jam out there!! FIVE ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️,264799

265546,5.0,Well made and effective.,Works ok as designed could see it being affective for removing curvature kinda small though gotta max it out to get the meter halfway also the hole is kind of a tight squeeze. However does clearly state 8inch is max.<br /><br />So far the parts seem very durable and well made.<br /><br />Tip if both sides are not level it will kinda twist and wanna spiral😂,265546
265565,5.0,💚🥒,"I'm obsessed with anything cucumber scented. This smells like fresh squeezed cucumbers and I absolutely love it 💚🥒 I heard witch hazel is good for shrinking pores, but I myself don't have large pores so idunno. During my night time routine, I love putting this on my face with a cotton round before starting to moisturize. I'm sure witch hazel has good benefits, but the cucumber scent is what has me hooked so five stars 🙃",265565

266034,5.0,I’m addicted,This was my first purchase of this laundry soap and I will never be without it now. I mostly wash my towels and blankets with it but now I wash all my clothes with it. While I was at work my patient actually said wow! You smell amazing. I was like thanks! It’s my fancy laundry soap 😬,266034
266060,5.0,Works well for YOU and can be used for FUR BABY in tub.,So I ordered this because my daughter had a different one that I used on my dog in the tub LOL and it deshedded her so good !!!! So I ordered these. I really like the shape of these better it fits my hand perfectly. The rubber is thick and doesn't feel cheap made at all . I ordered one for me also and I like the feel of it on my scalp too it can feel like a little massage 💆‍♀️,266060
266081,2.0,Not a good sewn quality,Seemed like good quality until washed them as I put it on the part for the ear came unstitched and now doesn't fit on the face correctly 😒,266081
266115,1.0,Terrible. I’ve never met a sponge I liked so little :(,Can’t use product as it’s so soft and kind of slimy to the touch. The ONLY thing charcoal about it is it’s appearance and shape. NONE of that is charcoal for your skin. So basically it’s JUST a RUBBERY WEIRD SPONGE that DOES NOT exfoliate or wash skin. I don’t even know why anyone would sell this 🤷🏻‍♀️,266115
266181,5.0,It works 😎,😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😎 💦💦💦,266181
266615,5.0,Works 👍 great!,I love this! I had purchased a different one on here but it was like 1in thick. My hair is thin and short and I have very little so I ended up returning it because I knew it wouldn't do what I wanted it to do. I found this iron and I have to say I'm so happy. 😊 I used it and it was easy. Just gotta split your hair in 3 sections. It was fast and my hair looked great! I had a lot of good compliments ! It comes with a glove so u don't burn your fingers or hand. It's a bit heavy compared to some other ones but it's worth it!,266615

266707,5.0,Naturally good for you and taste good 2 thumbs up.,"First thoughts of Biotin is the flavor is very good not to thick goes down very easy . The packaging colors of red and black  help draw attention to the box as the colors together just fit . A+ for marketing there. The fact that it claims to be vegan / vegetarian natural organic with no gmo made with stevia not sugar , all help out with advertising as well ...✔️💯",266707

267892,5.0,Its like walking in a spring of the best smelling florals!,"Fantastic! Smells 100% pure neroli to me.<br /><br />This is an easy 5 put of 5 stars for me 🌟<br /><br />This yummy neroli oil comes in a great sized, 100 mL (over 3 1/3 oz) glass jar with a glass dropper (protected in Styrofoam) and even a little dropper nozzle, too.<br /><br />It smells natural and not synthetic to me. It has a very,very lovely warm floral scent to it.<br /><br />It says it is Leaping bunny certified. I'm not certain how that can be verified but I hope it is.<br /><br />This just seems like great quality neroli for a great price!<br /><br />The packaging was very secure and even had a little tab in the glass jar to keep in the oil during shipping (see picture). The packaging itself looks like it was made in China (so maybe not the most classy for like gifting). It's more functional than stylish. Works great for personal use.<br /><br />I'm excited to use this lovely neroli in my diffuser and also in some rollers for natural perfume!<br /><br />I'd recommend this product. It seems pure and like what it says it is and was shipped & packaged securely.",267892
267900,5.0,Feels great,Love how it feels on my skin. I usually use this on my skin after applying a serum to my face. I’ve used this after leaving it in the freezer for a bit and it feels amazing😁,267900

268538,5.0,Great cheaper dupe,These are great dupe of the Phillips/sonic electric toothbrush. They come with 2 back of electric toothbrushes. With 6 replacement heads with each one! They have 5 modes.<br />Few cons:<br />They are a bit tiny from normal electric toothbrushes. To turn off you have to go threw 5 modes before off.<br /><br />But for $$ and all stuff it cones with I would definitely recommend 👌,268538

Waste of my money!! And to think this was a Christmas gift to my chiro friend for passing her boards. The embarrassment of having to return the defective product, and to top it all I got just $350 back after paying $437 for it! SMFH 🤦🏽‍♀️",268752

269555,3.0,I'd advise ordering the original LEMON flavor.,"I thought ordering the Mixed Berry flavor would ""mask"" the fishy taste, but I think that was a mistake.<br />I believe the Lemon would be a better choice, since you normally think of Lemon complimenting fish dishes...so, it would make more sense, right?<br />I can't comment on it's effectiveness as yet, because I've only ingested one dose. Until this bottle is gone, I will try holding my nose like all those kids in the old-time B&W movies when they were force-fed codliver oil. 😜<br />Explanation of my ⭐ ratings:<br />1. Easy to swallow?<br />Is this a trick question? I believe they're actually asking if it went down smoothly...which it did...but the flavor itself was not agreeable to me. Yuck!🤮<br />2. Flavor?<br />I believe I've made myself clear on this previously...ICK!! 🤢...Think you just need to stick with the original LEMON...why mess with flavors that don't make sense.<br />3. Pain Relief?<br />I gave it 3⭐(middle of the road) because I have no opinion as yet...as soon as I feel I have one, I will update.<br />**UPDATE**<br />After 1 week, I see no marked change in my ""Pain Relief""...but one thing has been constant...I have been rifting up that horrible taste ALL DAY LONG!<br />No matter what I eat or drink, it ""stays with me""...🤢...I'm committed to ingesting the entire bottle to give it a chance though...even though I'm in misery because of the fishy burps 🙄.",269555

270685,5.0,You gotta have these on standby at all times,"This spray legit is a refresher for your clothing and much more.

272868,4.0,Using These For A Different Purpose,"I discovered a Foaming  spray cleaner specifically created for litter box cleansing.  I can't use the tub for cleaning anymore.  Per chance I stumbled across these mitts and tgey are perfect for wiping off the gross, kitty- stuff that can't be scooped away.  These are small, if you have large hands or fancy fingernails, I'd be skeptical of their usefulness bc they *are* a paper product.  For me, a DAP Senior with a 20 yo male cat and 3 active boxes, These used in conjunction w/the foam cleaner are perfect. The disposable factor is huge, , one less thing to wring out  or launder. I use several at a time but so what, the price is right and I'm not further damaging my hands, spine, useless right  hip cleaning the old fashioned way. No more sweaty rubber gloves that hold the filth.  I'm thrilled with these which are perfect for using on a yucky project.  I double up when a litter box is particularly and stubbornly stained.  NOTE: I Have NOT used for  furniture or other household dusting but will eventually give that a go,as well.<br />👍 from Boston for off-use projects.",272868

They did throw me out of Ketosis. Yes I keep track of what I eat very closely as I have to for my son as well. These contain Maltitol. (As stated on Medical News Today: Maltitol is a sugar alcohol that is not keto friendly. Although maltitol is technically a low glycemic index (GI) sugar, it still affects blood sugar levels. This effect is enough to prevent a person from entering ketosis.) please be careful. I know everyone is different. But if your keto for medical. Just be extremely cautious of ingredients in pre-packaged. But if your not keto and just want low carb they taste really good. LOL 😆",275618

When I bought it the moron salescritter gave me a stain cleaning kit that was all water based cleaners completely wrong for everything I bought. I got a stain on one of the dining room chairs and made the whole thing 10x worse. Not only was stain still there but I had the dreaded 'ring' where the cleaner dried 😡. After calling Lexington directly and learning for the first time all this furniture was dry clean only I researched and found this product. It took too easy applications- spray on, let dry, brush off- and it cleaned up everything perfectly even the ring from the other cleaner. Great product!",276904

279556,5.0,Glad I purchased them and i like the very fine grit on them.,"I don't file my nails often after I clip them and I should which is why I finally decided to purchase some nail files. I've used the regular wooden files in the past so decided to buy some to have handy in my purse and I came across these glass ones and based on their reviews and the research I did to decide what's better, I came across some bit of information that explains about why glass files are better and I thought why not. I've never filed my nails with glass files so I wanted to try it. It definately feels different than the wooden ones. It's a matter of getting used to them and they do their job well. They look fancy and the colors are pretty. I also like that they each come in their own hard case for storing in your purse. One of my daughters says they look cool and they look like swords or lifesavers because they come in a case and she swings one around Haha. Kids and their imaginations 😄. I gave her one so she can learn to file her nails and it turned out to be a cool toy as well.<br />I'm attaching a screen shot of the information I found about glass files and their benefits.",279556

I have been dealing with dry skin causing smile lines and fine lines and wrinkles under eyes and above my cheek bones. After application I went to bed and woke up this morning with those fine lines and wrinkles gone!!! The smile lines greatly diminished!!! I mean like they are gone baby!!! My whole face looks youthful again and feels soft!!! If this didn't work I was going to go to Dillards to by some products to take care of these fine wrinkles and smile lines, not any more! Dang! I feel like I got my sexy back!!!<br /><br />Next thing I'm applying it on is my body and hair and ingest 3 drops to see what happens. Surely, nothing but good benefits but time will tell.<br /><br />As for the oil it has a nutty smell. It's light yellow in color. It's not thick but is thinner then most oils. Absorbs instantly into skin and won't leave a greasy oily feeling behind which is great which means no oily sheets or clothes. Didn't clog my pores which is a big deal. This bottle should last you awhile especially when mixed with other oils. A little bit goes a long way.<br /><br />I haven't tried appling my makeup to see how it looks yet, I'm sure it'll do great.<br /><br />Rose hip oil make way, bc I found me a winner! 😁<br /><br />I will say this oil is a must buy.

So that's a plus, did not give 5 stars because did not receive an instruction sheet.<br /><br />Have yet to try product going to update review once I do try the kit out.<br /><br />Would like to update, finally used the kit on myself and was very easy to use after doing some research on YouTube and Google.<br /><br />1st: glued pink silicone rod to my eyelid. Then put glue on a section of the silicone and started gently laying lashes on the rod till they would stick (very important not to clump otherwise results will not be flattering) work with a small section of lashes. Glue needs to be a little tacky. This part was the most time consuming<br />2nd: gently put solution A on lashes for 13 mins. Then gently cleaned with warm water on a cotton then applied solution B for 13 mins as well and cleaned with warm water on a cotton again. After that applied solution C ther cleanser and started to remove the glue with that and then applied solution D the eyelash restore and cleaned up the the glue left over on lashes if any, then applied the mascara and my results were amazing!<br /><br />This kit truly is easy to use and possible to do on your own like I did. Would like to add that I showered afterwards and woke up the next morning and my eyelashes are still curled up :) !! Will update how long they last me until I need to do another touch up.<br /><br />Note: excuse my fugly brows, but my eyelashes were stick straight and could not even hold a curl and because of this kit I no longer have to even worry about using an eyelash curler any more 😊",283397

To my fellow parents of kiddos on the autism spectrum or whose kids who like to deconstruct things: the pillow is wonderful and soft and a great sensory experience, but beware: there is no screw attaching the battery cover to the vibrating device inside the pillow, and no way to lock or secure the zipper. 😱 This is a HUGE design flaw in my mind, especially for a product targeting special needs kiddos and a huge safety concern as we know our kiddos can sometimes put batteries in their mouth! ⚠️",286987

He drinks a 16 oz Junp drink every day to replenish his electrolytes. In the summer, he might drink 2 because he spends a lot of time outside. He loves how quickly he recovers from the heat. Once he saw all the ingredients and the health benefits of Junp, he knew he would make this a lifetime habit. He sleeps better. He has less leg cramps and definitely more energy. The list of benefits is quite amazing. So now we’re both enjoying Junp daily and have been for over a year now.  The 2nd best thing is our container has 90 servings. That’s .33 a drink. - Totally beats the other competitors prices and flavors. We love the peach flavor. 🍑",289280

289635,4.0,I want to start off by saying...,"I hate the glue in this, I don't even have thick lashes and trying to adhere the silicone to my eyelid was a feat, and my eyelashes to silicone an even larger feat... if you already have lash glue from faux lashes try using that instead.<br />Maybe since my lashes were so straight they needed a little extra work, but I'll use the sticky cotton rolls next time definitely since it'll probably be A LOT less messy than silicone.<br />That's the only reason for 4 stars otherwise, otherwise this does exactly what it says. It honestly isn't rocket science as far as the perm, relaxer, cleanser and restore process as long as you don't get any of them in your eye (Doi). I'm not sure if the black lash mascara with it is suppose to make the lashes permanently darker or what but either way its still pretty nice.<br /><br />Update: Tried with the adhesive cotton rods and applied them straight to my lid and dabbed a small line of glue on it, waited for it to get tacky and pressed my lashes straight to it and wah-lah, 40 minutes less than the silicone ones! Really glad they included the cotton rods, if anyone was wondering what they were for 😊 I also believe the mascara that comes with it is tinting mascara!",289635

291916,1.0,Noisy and doesn’t last!!,"I purchased this item about a year ago for my mom  and it has only been used a handful of times – maybe five – and has been incredibly well taken care of, and she tried to use it last week and the bubble function has stopped working altogether.  The vibrate function still works but when you press the bubbles button there is incredibly loud motor type noise that occurs but the bubbles do not come out.  This machine has always been very noisy, it’s one of the things that I didn’t like about it right off the bat, but at least the bubbles worked, and the heat and vibrate buttons, and it seem to be enjoyable enough to try to disregard the very loud noise the machine made. The vibrate button is kind of useless in my opinion because it just feels weird on your feet. Now it’s noisy but there are no bubbles at all so basically it’s just a foot bath.  I’m incredibly frustrated because this was not a cheap item and there’s no reason that should already have stopped working. I tried everything I could to troubleshoot but  I could not get any bubbles to come out whatsoever.  I would recommend going with a different item unless you want a very noisy machine that is likely to give out on you after a few uses! 😞",291916

It is hands down the best mushroom supplement I’ve tried and the only time I have felt real effects... and I’ve tried Four Sigmatics, Freshcap, and Real Mushrooms. I realized it was because all of those companies only sell the hot-water extract of Lion’s Mane, and you’re supposed to consume the alcohol extracts of Lions Mane to benefit cognitive function, one of the many things I learned from Mogus instagram 😁😍 My decision making and mental clarity is better than ever.

He said he’d have to perform surgery but wouldn’t because I was breast feeding...so he wanted to give antibiotics...which we already tried and it didn’t work.<br />Why throw away most of your savings to an eye doctor who just wants to do surgery or prescribe antibiotics when you can spend just $24 for this product? Lol this is a Godsend! Thank you!!",296160
296232,5.0,Effective in brightening! ✨,"35 mL of yellow liquid—of runny and watery consistency—is housed in an elegant teardrop-shaped glass bottle with a glass dropper.  There’s a hint of citrusy scent to this.  I use this generously so three drops go on my face and two on my neck (AM and PM routines).  This absorbs well and doesn’t leave behind any stickiness.  My skin feels moisturized after application.  This works and layers well with all the products I use too. 😊  As I was testing this out, I tried to minimize using products with niacinamide just so I can observe if this ampoule really does what it claims.  I can happily report that this helps and works just as effectively in making my skin look clearer and more even-toned! ✨  Take note, though, that the aftereffects aren’t as dramatic as the first time I’ve used niacinamide, Vit C, and/or AHA.  Still, some of my hyperpigmentations are already fading.  I still have a few more I can’t wait to be rid of, but I’m positive that this ampoule will continue to work.<br />Will recommend and repurchase 👍🏽",296232
296272,2.0,It's a gamble,First two times I ordered these they worked like a charm. Not for 3 days but they did work fast and for about 24 hours. The third batch I bought (which was supposedly the same batch # as the other two according to the sticker 🧐) barely worked. I took 4 and kinda had results. The rest I chomped every few hours or so and never had any effect... I noticed the ones that did work before had a slightly medicinal taste compared to the last few which tasted like weak tootsie rolls or weak old coffee. I'd try elsewhere unless your rich and desperate. 😕,296272

When your wearing layers of clothing ( I’m a crossing guard ) the last thing you want to do is try to adjust the temperature with all those layers…very difficult 😖. The remote 📱makes all the difference. There is one thing I found that  helps considerably.  I wear over boots over my regular 🥾 boots. This really insulates the heat from escaping through my regular boots. I realize this may be difficult or inconvenient for some, each to their own, but it works very well in extremely cold weather. I do the same for my heated gloves🧤. If this gets  me through bad winter I’m happy 😀.",297652

She’s tried other brands before that didn’t do the job - they fell apart or were too abrasive. Luckily for me, these Lulu Essentials pumices had the opposite effect. They are well made, and smoothed out her heels. (I can’t axtually touch her feet again without that sandpaper feel 😬). She’s so impressed and well, I’m a happy husband again.

299385,2.0,It's ok...,"*Update 10/09/18 -  I dropped my rating a star because of my customer experience. I received a call from Nutraholics today not to apologize for what I experienced, not to offer a replacement product, but only to ask me to change the wording of my review? So here you go... I received the product at a discount, however my honest review of the product (which hasn't changed) is 100% from ME and not because they asked, but because I felt like it. 😁<br /><br />I received this product at a discount. The texture at first glance is very different than other MCT oil powders that I've tried. I added it to my coffee and blended it and unfortunately it leaves a chalky film at the bottom of my cup, even after thoroughly blending it. I've never experienced this before...maybe too much of the tapioca dextrin used as the carrier? It does however curb my appetite and give me a boost of energy so it has at least some decent MCT oil in it too. I probably wouldn't buy it again unless the formula was changed to dissolve smoothly.",299385

299795,5.0,Wonderful !,"Originally I was looking for the Eufora “beautifying serum” (white bottle with blue label and pump). However, the price has increased and I decided to try a different one. I’m really happy with this oil. I think it’s actually been better for my hair than the other one. My hair is straight and fine. I apply the oil on damp hair, right after the shower. Makes it way easier to brush my hair and I noticed my hair is easier to manage overall without dryness. Initially, I really did not like the smell from the bottle. Although, after applying it, the smell seemed to dissipate pretty quickly. I really like that it doesn’t leave an oily layer or residue on my hair. It soaks in nicely. Highly recommend 👍",299795

305286,4.0,Easy use & heats quickly but curl is modest. 👀,"Okay, I love the idea of a heated lash curler as an alternative to the old clamp and curl I’ve used for my entire make up wearing life. In theory, this sounded great, but the results were not quite as impressive for me as I hoped.<br /><br />PROS:<br />☑️ Simple to use (after you’ve applied your mascara) and takes about 10 seconds to heat up. The display goes from a purplish-pink to white when ready.<br />☑️ 4 different heat settings from 55-85—displayed in celsius only—to choose from based on coarseness of lash hair. Also, the display is very clear and easy to read for temp and battery charge.<br />☑️ Extremely lightweight and similar dimensions to a tube of mascara.<br />☑️ Rechargeable, so no need to mess with batteries. And since the amount of time it gets used is so brief, the charge really does last.<br /><br />NOTABLES:<br />🔘 I tried each of the settings on various occasions, and it took the highest (85C) to see much of any curl. As you can see from the before and after pics, the curl I got was so minimal, I’m not sure it made much of a difference for the effort? HOWEVER, I will say using heat did seem to creating a more LASTING curl to the lash, which is something.<br />🔘 Now, if this design had incorporated a minimal level of heat ALONG with the clamp style, then I think you could achieve a really amazing (and lasting) lash curl!<br /><br />Perhaps others will have more obvious results? As for me, I’ll likely use this on occasion, while still returning to my OG, tried and true, lash curler that is a bit more effective in creating a pronounced curl at the base of the lashes.",305286

But when I opened the box (the packaging is super nice, and has plenty of everything) I was surprised by how well this item was thought out. It has several attachments, detailed instructions, and plenty of the pads, so I can use it for months (maybe even just shy of year with once a week use) before thinking about needing more.<br />I took a shower first to open my pores and the attachment got so much gunk that I was shocked.<br />I do wear make up daily, but I have a pretty thorough regimen to cleave my skin, so I didn't think much would happen. But the little whiteheads under my lip are nearly gone with one use and it even cleaned the crease of my nose with little effort.<br />Pro tip: sit it on the skin and pull back in sections. Don't leave it sitting, the auction is strong. I look almost as good as I did post facial two weeks ago. Super radiant. This machine is awesome!<br />I'll be adding this to my regimen for sure 👍👍😁😁",306542

I've been disappointed by other natural deodorants before (lookin' at you, Lumé) but this one actually works! While it does come in a bar instead of a stick, to minimize packaging, it has a very similat consistency to refular deodorants like dove or degree. It is much less greasy than those, however, and only a small amount rubs off on your hands. (If you keep the paper it comes in you can hold it with that and not waste any 😊)  I put this on after a shower and don't sweat at ALL during normal activities. If it's hot or I'm exercising, I reapply as needed (not very often) and only sweat a little! It also blocks odor really well! I don't smell at all, and the scent of the deodorant itself (I got botannica) is a very light, pleasant, powdery sort of smell that doesn't become overpowering when you sweat! All in all, this is the best deodorant, natural or not, that I have ever used! I'm not ever using anything else!",316786

Its also great in the car for night driving when the littles need some light. It’s perfect.  Highly recommend.👍🏻,320703

With that being said I purchased this bowl a while ago and have just now made my way around putting it together and im sad to say it but many of the fittings will need to be replaced.  For example; the drain is defective most all of the o rings that twist onto the pipes have bad threads in them.  We had to replace gaskets, and whole entire drain with another one.  No matter how we tried this drain fittings wouldn't stay together and kept pouring water and popping off, worst then leaking.  Very dissatisfied that these sort of corners had been cut by shampoo bowl manufacturer,  new drain and pipes plus fittings added another $50 or more to the cost.  Doesn't seem to have been worth not going with a different product purchase.  Hair trap as well is pretty crappy.  And don't get me started with the free gift of the supposed to be silicone neck cushion, its sticky and slimy when wet or dry.  Overall I give it a 3 stars 🌟🌟 🌟. Purchased the one thats $200.00 instead.",326241

The cuffs were very soft and absorbent ( a plus if things get a little sweaty as was my case, lol). They were also easy for me to strap myself in so i could suprise my partner. He just had to adjust the slack to his liking so i couldn't move. There are MANY positioning possibilities with these restraints. You can also use them with a blindfold, riding crop, etc. These are optional of course, lol. This has definitely been added to the favorites stash and will get many uses. I absolutely love it!

Which defeats the main reason why I purchased this. There’s a serious design flaw because wet hair gets caught up and curled into the blades which are not removable.🙄<br /><br />3. Cuts well wet, but not as close as my old razor (again I bought this one for faster cleaning)👌<br /><br />After the first use, I’m already requesting a return refund from Amazon, and while I try it for another 2-3 days—-I doubt I’ll be that patient. 😤",335359

342120,5.0,Chalazion 4 days of treatment,"So back in late November I developed a stye on my lower lid. I treated it like normal. (Cleaned it daily, applied warm compresses.) Normally for me these clear up in a week or so, but this one did not. The head went away but the stye turned hard and was somewhat painful by the end of December I went to my eye Dr. He said the stye had turned into a chalazion and that more than likely I would have to have it cut out. He gave me a heavy dose of antibiotics to take along with an expensive eye drop Azasite ($60 after insurance). I was also to continue to do hot compresses 3 times a day. He said if by the end of January if there was no improvement he would schedule the removal 😬 (He seemed very sure that surgery would be my outcome). By January 23rd I had not noticed any improvement at all.... the chalazion hurt when I cleaned it or pressed on it in any way. I ran across this product and placed my order...after all what did I have to lose right?!? I received the product quickly by the afternoon of the 26th I did my first application which was when I took the first picture (top). I continued my hot compresses as well ( also taking fish oil tablets by this point as well). By the second day my chalazion felt really like it was going to explode so I took this to mean there was  definitely something happening within my chalazion. It was very sore when I rubbed in the oil that afternoon even more so than before. By the next day the size had a noticeable improvement and all scoreness was gone. I could literally press very firmly with a q-tip and have no pain (3 days in using this product) . I am at day 4 now (2 pic bottom).  I definitely feel I am on my way to getting rid of this. I will continue using this product til it clears up and possibly some after to make sure. I will update as to my outcome and how long my process took. But for now I can say it is not an overnight fix but it seems to work and I wish I had used this in the beginning because I feel like it would not have drug out this long. I recommend this to anyone who wants to  avoid surgery.<br />*** Update Day 5****<br />Woke up this morning to a head that has appeared on the chalazion!! This is a great sign☺️ (pic 3)<br />***Update day 6****<br />The chalazion had two heads that had appeared yesterday this morning one popped after applying a hot compress the other popped while I was applying the oil to my lid. I am seriously impressed with this product!! I am not going to take a photo today. There is still some redness but the hard bump in completely gone!!! I will wait til tomorrow to take the photo and update on where I am. Amazing!!!! So happy to avoid surgery 😁😁😁",342120

I wonder why the package doesn’t specifically say it’s from Canada and not China bc the quality was more like tainted imported oral products from China that I have bought b4 in the past that the packaging didn’t mention country of origin it’s not from canada with.

I think my foot injury and back pain are linked. I purchased this in hopes of healing my foot more quickly. Having it at a 90 degree angle at night really helps, but I usually end up with my feet pointing down, so this product will keep it in place. So far so good. Easy to use. Comfortable.

I have really bad melasma with huge, clogged pores, but after using this serum before bed, I wake up in the morning with visibly more even tone. Don't get me wrong, if you're looking for dramatic results, you'll have to get stronger stuff like retinol, vitamin c, hydroquinone, IPL, and microneedling, but for those in-between-treatment days, this serum is a skin-saver! So gentle, soothing, and effective at maintaining the results of my treatments! Also, it doesn't break me out! Huge plus!😄 I will definitely be be repurchasing this serum! I love it!",358445

It’s lasted several years without breakage or other problems!<br /><br />The allergy “buttons” are not all that easy to get in, which is annoying, but once they are in, you don’t have to worry about them coming out👍🏻😉, which is very much appreciated with active kids!<br /><br />Recently bought a second set because my child developed another allergy and we couldn’t find the other buttons from the previous set.",360305

361144,4.0,Works great for my needs,"I bought this to clean off my gutter guards without having to use a ladder. It works perfectly for that! I also tried to get the pine needles of my roof with it. It didn't really work for that part. Although you can change the angle of the brush, you can't change the direction of it. So I couldn't get the perfect angle and direction to sweep off the roof. ALSO and almost most importantly, when you extend the handle the pole is extremely heavy and unmanageable. Every time I tried to clean the roof the pole would either bang against the gutters or slam into the roof. I was afraid I was going to damage both. So I'm just sticking to cleaning the gutter guards.<br />Also USPS said the box was too long for them to deliver and forced me to come pick it up. So just be aware that you might have to pick up.

367179,3.0,If you don't have a tile floor,"I purchased this several months ago because I was tired of repeatedly throwing away the plastic boxes that my usual floss came in. I loved this small, very attractive glass container. The floss was fine. It says it's mint, but I didn't notice any particular flavor. I finished the first spool of floss and replaced it with the refill without a problem. And then, a few days later it fell on the tile bathroom floor and broke. Small shards of glass scattered across the floor. I'm pretty sure I haven't found them all. I guess it will still work although it's broken with some duct tape. 😢 To the manufacturer: Maybe a metal container would be a better idea.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used electric tape to hold the pieces together and protect it from more falls. I should have done this from the beginning, I guess. Like the Otterbox on my iPhone.",367179

369611,5.0,Men’s Quiet Electric Razor,"The BEAUTIPLOVE  Model BP-8219 (ASIN-B0978WC56R) PORTABLE ELECTRIC SHAVER is a three head design, rechargeable with internal battery and real-time (minutes)remaining digital readout. This model is provided with Shaver Replacement Head. It is no-tools press fit replacement ( See below ). Additional  accessories include: USB Charger cable (NO AC Power Module), 3 cleaning brushes, Sideburn Trimmer, Cloth storage travel bag and User Manual.<br /><br />The black part of the razor has a rubberized type material.  It provides grip both when wet and dry. There is a plastic cap ( cover ) that fits over the shaver heads. It's loose fit and falls off easily with test unit. The single switch provides control for all functions. Single push ON and OFF. Holding the switch will lock the control for travel. Hold for three seconds to unlock .<br /><br />Operation is single speed. I have sensitive skin at time of test and the razor provides a good shave with no irritation. I used both dry and slightly damp skin/beard conditions with equal satisfactory results for me.  The final cut was close but not totally smooth as I was cautious due to the skin sensitivity. Appearance was freshly shaven.<br /><br />Cleanup is by allowing the shaver to run over sink or slightly submerged in warm water. Once,  I removed the head to clean it and the rubber gasket underneath. It is press fit to reinstall.<br />Recommended  Five  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Star<br /><br />Thank you for looking at my review.

His boils  seem like they were retreating and his  ache scars seem to be shrinking somewhat,  well it's been about one month in  and I am stunned at the difference this has made in Sons  life!  The pits in his face are almost completely closed up and his acne has cleared up almost completely!!!

I do brush twice a day and floss. I thought I was a good brusher and flosser 😬. This stuff shows me the error in my ways and I love it for that. . .<br /><br />Pro tip: Only do this at night and it will (temporary) turn your bristles pink because, trust and believe, you will brush you teeth again after using a tab.",373665

I’m a little iffy on the science behind these but I gave them a go because why not?! It couldn’t be worse than being car sick all the time anyhow. This summer, our family has had loads more road trips but I started testing them in small increments. First, I tried checking my phone when my husband was driving (even briefly this would typically give me a headache and I’d start feeling car sick) but I didn’t have any problems. Then I tried them on long car rides with windy roads, also no car sickness. At this point, I can play games on my phone and am so happy about this find. I leave them in the car and break them out anytime I start feeling carsick or will be using my phone. FYI: I get strange looks and I don’t try to make eye contact with passing cars but who cares?! I’ve recommended them to family and friends as well😊",375682

I mixed it in with some lemonade and couldn’t taste any difference. Might take a lemon and fish oil shot for tomorrow’s “wake up” 😂. It tastes great and is great for you.

I use it on the back of mine and my kids necks when we have colds and it instantly allows air through congested nostrils and lungs. It works wonders and truly does provide instant relief to headaches when applied to the temples. And my daily place I use it is on any knots I may have in my neck and shoulders and I can't say how much the menthol relieves pain and tension!!<br /><br />Absolutely obsessed with literally *every* magnificent concoction I've tried! I always get more when I run out and I will continue to do so☺ I started shopping here locally when I got pregnant with my second child. Wanted to use more organic and once I started trying a bit here and there I became addicted lol I noticed everything I got WORKED more than a million other chemically filled and pricey products.. I love buying from places where the products actually do *exactly* what they claim, so if you feel the same, believe me, you NEED to try A&M!<br /><br />Since converting to these specific amazing natural products I am legit hooked🙌 Their deodorants work wonders and are literally the first/only natural deodorant I have found to finally WORK😀👍 Their anti aging products make a noticeable difference even in the first week of use(two of my favs are the Vitamin C Facial Moisturizer and the Liquid Gold AntiAging Serum)..<br /><br /> The rollers and sprays actually add peace and joy to my days, totally help aching muscles and relieve anxiety, etc.(I suffer from OCD and PTSD as well as awful knots in my neck and shoulders and the Relief Roller and Relief(as well as the Peace) CBD salve- and even more products, have literally been such a blessing to me for relieving stress and physical pain- GRATEFUL)! Everyone I've gifted these products to totally love them just as much and get hooked too.

384734,5.0,Pretty Good So Far!,"I've recently received this ""Posture Corrector"".  I've only had a short time wearing it, but so far its pretty good and I  like it very much.  Just note, like with any corrector your body will have to adjust to wearing it over time.  A few years ago, I had a single back strap style bought it from a brick and mortar store.  After putting it on over a hoodie twice while trying it out to keep it very clean, I felt nothing different, and I wasn't sure what it was trying to do so I returned it. However, for this style I have now, I do feel my shoulders being pulled back, nothing else though.  Truthfully..., I really don't know what exactly you are suppose to feel straightening up, since I only feel my shoulders being squeezed together.  I guess, it's doing something!  LOL! But time will tell when if my neck is able to hold my head up higher without constantly dropping it back down.  Hopefully! After time it won't say, ""Nope! I still can't do it, now go find something else😄!""  Well, I ordered the full upper back covering style pictured. Here are my photos, so check them out because one thing for sure this corrector is made, and stitched extremely well.  Look at the nice zip lock storage packaging, along with the colorful detailed instructions card to hang up on the frig.  Well... that's where I put it as a reminder to don't take another snack, and put it on.  Also, the comfort wraps, those square things are nice and thick, plus also made very well. The weather is hot, so I do think after many hand washing cycles, all three items will hold up for a very long time. LOL! Of course I can't forget to mention the disappointing cons, well its only one. The wrap around pull straps are too short.  Yet, on Amazon they appear much longer, but they are little wee bit difficult to grap to pull, and if someone with a much wider upper back, the straps may end up fastening slightly under their armpits instead of closer to their shoulders as pictured.  But if it does, I guess you could try giving the comfort wraps a go under the armpits.  So would I recommend this style of ""Posture Corrector"" to friends.  ABSOLUTELY☺!!!  It's made very well.  It is a short time wearing it, so once I start to see changes within my posture, I will give a final update.",384734

Or in my case--- a Supervillian! Muhahaha💀<br /><br />I have purchased a few of these Xotic eyes in several colors... This one did not disappoint. Beautiful foil gold and pink tones with pink & gold gems really make this accessory pop. If you are careful and patient--- you can get many uses out of them. Which is what you want because they are not cheap!!! All you need to do is store them between some wax paper and apply a very thin layer of lash glue to them to reuse. I have not used the glue they come with--- so I cannot comment on how good it is. I use DUO brand lash glue.<br /><br />Just be super careful not to let this applique touch itself as it will stick and you won't be able to get it apart without ruining it. Peel off slowly and carefully. Hold it up to your face (with the backing on) so you know how it's going to look.... Symmetry for both eyes is key!😜<br />Basically--- worth the purchase if you take care of them!,385331

397783,5.0,Perfect for chaffing and blister prevention,"I'm an avid runner and have some sensitivity to my own sweat. This brings about raw chaffing from seams on sports bras (and I've tried almost every brand in the 10+ years I've been running). I came across a similar product years ago which I can no longer find and this cover roll is almost identical! No, chaffing products like body glide do not do the job - at least not nearly as well as this cover roll 😉. I run 1-2 times a day and tape up my chest area where the bra seams and chest strap will sit and enjoy the run 🏃‍♂️ and happy to get as sweaty as I want! I also use it for hot spots on my feet. Long distance runners will know what I mean when you've run your shoes in but not ready for a new pair. This cover roll prevents hot spots and blisters! And if you're breaking in a new pair of shoes, tape up the likely areas on your feet and you're ready to go! On occasion I have used cover roll for large grazes over a dressing and you can get through multiple showers without changing the dressing. It adheres very well and will peel off nicely if you peel on a 180 degree back over the area. Don't try to peel it off by ripping it off or pulling in a 90 degree angle from the area... you could end up with missing skin! Do it correctly and you'll feel comfortable dressing and redressing twice a day. Also, this seller gets the product to you before the estimated time by Amazon. It was supposed to arrive Sunday evening by 9pm and received it Saturday lunch time. I'm about to order another 2 rolls!",397783

They will definitely be easier to sanitize. I will not rely on them as my main clippers thoughbut for the price it definitely get the job done. It is difficult to use for the top of the head but perfect for sides and nape! The sizes are not numbered in 1 2 3 they are I believe in cm. The thinning blade is nice to have as well as the numbers of battery life I’ll be using it to time myself for haircuts from now on 😂 I will post a picture of my sons hair cut using them in a few minutes,400168

Going ""down"" is always easy BUT getting up on the other hand - a little bit harder ... just a little 😄.<br /><br />I've resisted buying this handy tool ... stubbornness, pride, denial ... but finally got smart Nov 22.<br /><br />This is a great gift for loved ones with back, knee, balance issues.  Even without these issues ... it's also pretty handy in helping you reach in the hard to reach areas, behind desk, cupboards.<br /><br />I hate to admit l waited too long to buy this.  Sooo ... moving forward read what l wrote above 👆.<br /><br />WHAT'S TO LIKE ... Price (2 grabber tools), sturdy, usefulness, foldable for transport.

But I kid you not, this cutter is so accurate and didn't move the slightest bit. I have big oblong pills that are hard to cut and this cutter sliced right through it with no problem at all. Wow!!!

410277,1.0,Weak adhesive,"The first box of these that I purchased came directly from my son’s eye doctor and they were great. They stayed on all day and my son never complained about wearing it on his eye (sometimes for as long as 6 hours). Even when wet from the sprinkler, or a day of sweating outside, they did not peel off.  When we ran out of those, I ordered the next box from Amazon. They are terrible! I noticed a difference in the quality right away. They don’t fully adhere to his eye and start peeling off within an hour of wear.  And my son surely notices a difference in the level of comfort because he asks to take it off several times while he it on.  They seem like an old box that have been sitting around in sunlight for too long and they lost their adhesiveness.  Very disappointed in the poor quality of this purchase, especially since it has such an important purpose. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",410277

416897,4.0,Great for fertility & PCOS!!! 💓,These are really great if your stuggling with infertility or pcos or blood sugar. I bought these along with the M2 Tone red tablets that both help really well. The M2 tone tablets helped regulated my periods that were also very heavy. I noticed I felt better moods taking these and saw a lot more CM. Other girls from sites say they have taking these and got pregnant. Now I am from the US & they ship these from India but you get them pretty fast in the mail. You need to take 4 a day of each pill if your taking the M2 tone and these. So 2 of each in the morning and 2 of each kind at dinner time with a meal. So that’s 8 you would take a day. It’s not really that bad and they are easy to swallow they are not that big. There is really no taste to them but you can taste a little chalk taste. They are good for the price so buy a box as needed to last you. Good luck & update if you buy these I would like to know how others are doing with them as well. 💛,416897

422163,5.0,Exactly What This Optician Was Looking For,"I’d had nothing but problems keeping my plastic framed glasses from sliding down my nose.<br />After countless readjustments of the temple curves nothing seemed to help.  This was super annoying as<br />I’ve been adjusting glasses professionally for 24 years and have been employed as an optician for the past 3....  🙄<br />My nose bridge size is a bit smaller than the bridge size of the glass, so I wondered if filling in the difference would help.<br />The pads were super easy to apply, and you could use scissors to customize the size if you wished.<br />They take up just the right amount of space to keep my glasses up.  Combined with a correctly adjusted temple curve, they work perfectly.<br />With the pads only being 1mm thick, they don’t look awkward at all.<br />I chose this particular item because they provide both clear and black pads.  The black pads look perfect on black frames, the clears are great for all other frame colors.<br />I’ve had them on my glasses for about a month now and no signs of them peeling off yet.  I’m assuming the amount of perspiration one has and one’s body chemistry will affect these pads at different rates.  At these prices, I don’t mind needing to change them occasionally.<br />I have recommended these pads to many of my customers, and now I’m recommending them to you too.<br />Wish we carried them at my store....",422163

I used it well boating and had morning sickness (double wammy I get sea sick) and I wasn't nauseous and was able to go to lunch after. For temporary use it's great! Boating/ motion sickness awesome! I'm sick for 4 month straight well pregnant and it helps but by the end of the day I feel like I'm going insane from the zapping. On bad days I still put it on. But the rest of the time it's better with out it. But like I said it for sure works. Even though my review may seem negative I would buy it again and if I had a pregnant friend that was green in the face I would recommend it to her for outings and bad days. It does take a little while to work and it works better when ur ahead of the nausea so put it on early 😊,428112

429746,3.0,Not pain but tedious process,"Using this whitening kit is a little tedious because molds are large and cause your mouth to salivate, then the gel from molds get mixed with saliva. Then you have to put the light against your teeth and hold it with your lips which further increases salivating 😑 I honestly think the gel gets diluted with all that saliva and have a hard time telling is there any difference.

Lastly, chunk of scrubbing part tore AND the top nearly completely separated from the rest of the sponge. 3 uses only!

I am adding to cookies and most of our food because my boy doesn’t want meat or beans so this is a good protein addition to his diet without fighting at a dining table. I am very happy with this product. I received this free of charge for the review but will definitely continue to buy.

Loved every last bag except for my last 2.  They're not doubling or tripling in size when soaked now...<br />This is not how it's supposed to look.<br />It usually gels right away. It barely made a gel overnight.  Not pretty, bountiful batches anymore.😫  I want my good batches again.  I depend on sea moss for my pain, but for so much more.  My family also uses it now.  They depend on me making it.<br />Trying to talk to someone about what's going on since Friday.  I really don't want to change suppliers.",432486

But he bought this one because of the light color, soft looking straps, & black carrying bag it comes with. I’ve been wearing it for a couple of days and so far so good. I was able to put it on myself and adjust the straps quite easy. I put it to the test when I was cooking dinner which usually standing on my feet for awhile …my back starts to burn and ache. I’m 44 and have scoliosis so I guess my condition gets worse over time.  But honestly because the straps pull my shoulders back I felt relief right away.  I told my husband…this thing works. I was so excited that I kept it on all day…lol. Now I just need to remember to wear it everyday and not just when I have back pain. Glad I took a chance on this one😊",432532

441753,5.0,On the expensive side but you're getting what you're paying for I guess...,So anyone looking for incontinence issues this is strictly going to be a home alone or everyone already knows type of diaper as you can see in the picture I've provided that they are very bulky and hard to hide but that's what I love about them they hold a lot even without boosters I tend to leak out the sides before getting to use it all though for me the back doesn't get wet much. They are super squishy when wet and have the most amazing feel and the hybrid tapes are not just gonna fall off unless you're doing some really aggressive touch therapy on them I guess. 😅 This doesn't mean you won't have to adjust the tapes though and thankfully that's really easy and you can do it about 10 times with each tape before I'd say some of the hooks get worn out. If you buy these from the actual company Rearz you won't have any issues with them at least you shouldn't imo.,441753

448351,5.0,The REAL DEAL!,"I’ve been a seamoss user for some time now and my usual vendor that I order from has been out of stock for months! In the interim, I tried a Instagram user who advertised seamoss. I did not prefer it since it tasted like it was made from a pool, not the ocean.<br /><br />After doing some research on amazon, I came across this product and figured I would try it. All I can say is WOW! This is the real deal. You can see small crystals of salt, and it has the ocean scent. In my opinion, you get A LOT in the 8 oz package. Upon receiving the product, I immediately opened, smelled, touched, washed, then soaked.<br /><br />I use the blend method so I can add the seamoss to my smoothies. I then store the remainder in a glass jar which will last about 2 to 3 wks in the fridge. If you are looking for quality seamoss, this is it right here.<br /><br />Thank me later! 🙃🙂",448351

I agree that whey protein powders may have a more Appealing taste, but I would not sacrifice that for all the additives and fillers that often come with that! Also I found that the whey protein (specifically the Gold Standard) made my forehead breakout and upset my stomach!<br /><br />Regarding the taste of Perfect Fit Protein:<br />I have grown to absolutely love the flavor of it! I add it to my coffee, Greek yogurt, homemade granola, pancakes, smoothies, cookies etc (you can find some of my recipes here: [...] ). I also love that it has only  5 ingredients (all of which I can pronounce)!!!! Also you have to find what works for you, but I don't think protein powder should ever upset your stomach! Which is why I love this product (for the record I am not being paid and have no affiliation with Tone It Up). However, I am a certified personal trainer and recommend this to all of my clients (If they ask about protein powder supplementation). It have never experienced any problems with it! If you are curious about the flavor you should definitely order the packets and give it a try👍👍",452686

453562,4.0,"Still figuring out timing and dose, trial & error","Bought this to add to my own homemade pre-workout- and love the tingling effect that Beta-Alanine has in typical pre workouts.<br />Gave this a try because I love other Onnit products and trust their process.<br /><br />I’ve taken it four times now and still haven’t figured out dosing or the time release, and would’ve liked some more directions either on bottle or somewhere. 2 capsules are a serving, I felt no noticeable difference taking 3 capsules.<br /><br />Although this Beta-alanine doesn’t make me quite as tingly as other supplements have, I definitely feel like my workouts have been more focused and slightly more intense.<br /><br />I would recommend people to definitely give it a try! Onnit puts a lot of research behind their products 👍🏼",453562

I thought maybe the liner was cold from the air conditioner being on. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I walked into the bedroom as B was waking up and with every step I took I felt colder and colder!  I RAN back out almost in tears. It was as if this liner was made from Newport Extra Menthol Cigarette filters!! It felt like I put Vicks on my vulva. It felt like I switched the butt soap with Noxema. OMG if anything needed to be cryogenically frozen I think that did the trick!<br />😬 😱 😥<br />So, I jumped back in the shower but it was too late. My VaJessica was freezing  🥶 for another 20 minutes at least.<br />It’s been 15 hours and I‘m ok now, but I’m either having flashbacks or aftershocks.

455928,3.0,Not for me but probably great for someone else,I think this stuff  works for what it’s designed for but there are two things i think would dramatically improve this product. 1) I was disappointed to see after purchase that there are artificial sweeteners. I personally expect my supplements to be free from those. 2) the taste😖. maybe this is due to #1. i tried the apple and i think  it could be great but it’s not there yet.  However i am pretty set on having pure ingredients and if you aren’t and just want the benefits they market  this is probably wonderful fit for you!,455928

After about 15 mins of taking it, i was very relaxed and got sleepy and slept through the night. Also noticed my night sweats went away. I decided to try it with orange juice in a 6 oz cup it just tasted salty .  So I think if you are sensitive with taste try orange juice. But I definitely love it and I recommended it to a friend. She tried it and she said she slept through the night. She had been having difficulty sleeping. And by the way I weighed myself and lost 3 lbs. I haven’t been doing anything different 🤷🏻‍♀️",456145

Thankfully, it was within days of its “birthday” so I barely squeaked by on the warranty. Despite my name being Karen, I’m not in the habit of writing reviews or asking to speak to a manager. Now I’m not above it either. 😉<br />If I take the time to write a review, I’m displeased enough to take action. If I pay $129 for a stupid scale and I think it’s w/in a year, I’m moving heaven and earth to get it resolved. The CS rep tried giving me the “I’m sorry but you’re going to suck it up” song and dance. I’m not confrontational but this day I wasn’t having it. Somehow I wore them down and got a free replacement. That one lasted...yep, you guessed it...1 YEAR!!! With second crappy scale, the screen began to stay illuminated and run down the batteries. So after that and two Fitbit charge watches in a 5 year time span, I decided to get a $29 WiFi scale that connects to phone/and new apple watch. I’ve had the new scale/watch over a year and I’m not disappointed. I won’t waste anymore money with Fitbit.

463448,4.0,Real rating,"You either love it or hate it, first day I used it I loved it. It takes some getting use to it. I like the fact I don't really have to use a lot of my foundation a little goes a long way with this sponge. I have used it for concealer as well it does spread evenly from what I can tell but again PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE to find your technique. Cleaning it is amazing which is a plus for me vs cleaning my beauty blenders. The only downer I have is that my foundation sticks to it and smears on every inch of my sponge and fingers so I cant really get a good grip on it, so I have to clean it pretty much every time I use it. I'm still learning about it but for right now I'm happy with it😊",463448

475027,1.0,WAS the best plastic wrap -  no longer the same (2023),"Of all plastic wraps, even the high priced name branded Glad Cling Wrap, Great Value 300 was the best for sticking and staying stuck to whatever you wanted it to.  Now, sadly, it seems Walmart has discontinued the 300ft roll with slide cutter, leaving only the 200ft roll with basic razor edge available.  You would think the product in both packages was the same…think again!!  The product in the 300ft package was smooth and completely clear; the product in the 200ft package has vertical stripes in it, parallel with the outer edges of the film as you dispense it.  O.K., so it looks a little different…but wait, it doesn’t hardly stick to itself anymore let alone other objects.<br /><br />To be fair, this is my first roll of the 200.  I will peek at the next box on the shelf before buying it. If it has the same stripes in the wrap I will switch to Sam’s Club (Member’s Mark) wrap.  I like Sam’s equally, but their wrap only comes in a 3000ft countertop dispenser…a bit of a waste of countertop space for my kitchen; countertop space is limited.<br /><br />I’ve searched all Wally Worlds in my region, but sadly none have the 300ft available, and it isn’t available to order on Walmart’s website or app either. A sad day for my kitchen. 😢",475027

475211,5.0,Relieves severe itchiness related to (scalp) psoriasis,"Great for severe itchy scalp/psoriasis/eczema<br /><br />I had a dry itchy scalp over the last 5 months.<br />In May, it started becoming flaky, burning, and extremely irritated scalp. It was super uncomfortable at that point. Something I’ve never experienced (the last time my psoriasis was triggered was 6-7 years ago after skiing for a week on my chest and it went away fairly fast once back home with meds) so I was becoming really worried.<br /><br />Nothing was helping not even things my derm. gave me which included topical steroids and fluocinonide for the itching and even oral antibiotics at one point..... nothing worked so I started researching possible holistic long-term solutions.<br /><br />I cut out all possible triggers from my diet and that helped greatly. Then I saw this YouTube video where the girl mentioned psoriasis being related to gut issues and to try l-glutamine.... I bought it right away.<br /><br />This stuff is well worth it.<br />I take it every day along with multivitamins, probiotics (pill form and kimchi), D2 & K3, and my scalp psoriasis is making a fast turn around.<br />(I use liquid black seed oil, and shampoo with an elixir of Sebex/TGel intense itching XStrength and 2% Ketoconozale shampoo all together and let sit on my scalp for 5 minutes once per week)<br />There is no flaking, my scalp is clear and not burning or itching!<br /><br />At first, l-glutamine did make me break out all over my face. Like huge painful cystic acne but I assumed that meant my body was detoxing and I believe it was because I no longer am breaking out.<br /><br />I take 5mg in about 16oz of cold water and it doesn’t taste bad.<br /><br />I was curious to see how much the relief of my scalp itchiness/psoriasis was attributed to this powder so for the sake of science, I stopped taking it for one week and I did notice a slight itch coming on so I am confident that this really is a contributing factor to keeping my psoriasis under control.<br /><br />Also, I ordered it at 7am and it arrived at 10am the same day.<br /><br />I will be buying this again....<br />Stocking up actually! 😆✌🏼",475211
475215,5.0,Who knew! Curbs Alcohol/ sugar cravings for real!!!,"So... this is pretty cool! I have been suffering from diagnosed leaking gut and finally started taking Essential Stacks L-Glutamine and digestive enzymes. If you do the megadose protocol as I did, it works like a charm. Side note. I love wine and can easily drink a full bottle while cooking a beautiful meal, eating and relaxing after. Not something I am particularly proud of but a fact. Here’s the weird thing.. was doing my usual thing... getting food prepared to cook, wine opened, glass poured.. absolutely no desire to drink it. Still drank a glass and put a wine stopper in the bottle and set it aside. ( my husband put his hand on my forehead and asked if I was Ok😂) Out of curiosity, I googled “ L- Glutamine to take away alcohol cravings and was pleasantly surprised to see that YES, indeed it does dramatically curb alcohol/ sugar cravings.

They don't give you enough supply of this. When I opened it wasn't filled to the mid top more like half way filled.  For the price we should get more. The design on the container label poorly designed was completely slipping off container I had to keep slidingit back up the containerfor price we pay this shouldn't be. However I gave it 5 stars 🌟 🤩 because It works! I feel energetic and I have multiple bowel movements! It's totally vegan plant-based. I will definitely buy it again because I can't find it everywhere it's hard to find. It helps my immune system and I feel amazing after each consumption.

480720,3.0,Sadly Disappointed,"I never leave reviews, but instead rely on others' reviews to determine if I'd like to make a purchase. This scale got glowing reviews, for the most part. Hence why I bought it. I wish I had paid closer attention to the the not-so positive reviews. I received my scale and it's clean, sleek and gorgeous! The numbers are very visible, even in a brightly lit room, and it's great and convenient that batteries were included. I especially like that you're able to switch the weight reading between kilograms and pounds.<br /><br />That's where it ends, unfortunately. The readings are sadly and bizarrely inaccurate. Only my first weight reading was close to being accurate. All subsequent readings show my weight as 20 lbs lighter. Even though that's my immediate weight goal, I just know from weighing on other scales (work, the gym, the hospital, the mirror😩) that I haven't lost 20 lbs. Another disappointment is that the reading is different EACH time I step on it, off of it, then on it again. I do it 3-4 times and the reading is 2-4 lbs different on each occasion, including the lighter 20 lbs.<br /><br />It's annoying to see people give a product a low rating for what seems like a petty issue. However, this is just too much of an issue that now forces me to buy another scale. I have to lose a certain amount of weight for health reasons, and I need to be able to accurately assess my weight loss/gain. So sad...",480720

481578,5.0,Wow,This is the first time I’ve ever written a review! I ordered this because I was having Mega problems with my eye lashes. I got a eye lash lift about 5 weeks ago. I new something was wrong after I left the girls salon. My eye leashes were so far back they where curling and hitting my eye lifts. The next day my eye lashes felt so dry from the perm. I got the caster oil like she said. After a few days my eye lashes turn to fish hooks. All different sizes and falling out 😩. I don’t suggest getting it done. It’s to strong of a product to go around your eyes. But this tool. Saved my eye lashes in seconds. I’m so happy I could cry: I haven’t been about to wear eye makeup in so long. Tomorrow I shall be rocking mascara again. Thank you thank you thank you. 😍,481578

482090,5.0,Cute! Fits snug. I ordered a small and I have a medium boot,"I measured my surgical boot from the last time ( it was indeed 16 inches tall by 8 inches around) so I knew that the tall boot cover would fit. My surgical boot from my right foot was a small last time, so I ordered the small for my boot I was getting on my left.<br /><br />I am out of surgery and got a medium boot, but this boot stretched out over it well. I did not even undo the Velcro because it fit like a glove. The only thing it doesn’t do is zip up all the way if you don’t pull it to the top and over your boot ending (the part closest to your knee). I did notice that if I did pull it over the boot and zip it up all the way, it would leave an indention on my leg.<br /><br />However, all of that to say the small size fit snug but well enough on my medium boot. I would say they are true to size, but I am happy with how the small fits on the medium. It just means it won’t be going anywhere no matter how much I move around.<br /><br />I am excited because my toes are covered and I feel much safer from whatever the weather outside wants to throw at my foot. Not to mention I’m not ruining the Velcro on my boot by it attaching to the dog hair on the couch. 😂😂",482090

I’ve been using it instead of nasty chemical laden toothpaste for the past six months and am really pleased with how my teeth look and feel (which is squeaky clean, smooth and polished.) The minty factor isn’t very high compared to standard big brand toothpastes and of course it can get a little messy with black spit 😆but that’s a simple adjustment of letting the water run while spitting/rinsing.",482212

489624,3.0,"Product is great, accept that it no longer works","So I ordered this product really early in the year. I really like the product, it’s super quiet compared to the other one I had and it’s suction is so much better. However, I put it on the charger since it died. Honestly… I didn’t think it’d be dead dead… I left it to charge for about thirty minutes, when I went to check on it it was still red. But just to be sure I took it off and tried turning it on. I would have been happy if it had turned on, but no 😑… so I put it back on the charger, this time for an hour… same result. Well I put it back on and honestly forgot about it so it’s been on the charger all day today.<br />  You would think that it would be super charged by now and not have to be charged for a whole damn month and a half, but this snot catcher 2.0 is a gone with the wind. I haven’t even had it for a full year yet. But mostly, I’ve only used it 4 times since I bought it… and it’s little battery spirit decided that it had enough and took off…<br />  Like I said, it’s a really good product. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that it seems to not live that long. I promise there has been no damage to my device. It’s been in its box hidden away from my toddler so that she can’t play with it, so I have no Idea why it’s dead. I tried to see if I could get a replacement, however Amazon doesn’t seem to want to give me one for a faulty product. I really love this aspirator, but I wish it would last longer. It’s been the only aspirator that my toddler likes so far and it’s convenient considering the basin being washable.  I would have given the product two stars if I didn’t really like it. Overall it works really well it’s just the life of the product that sucks.",489624
489672,5.0,Love it,It’s a lovely little machine to help the tension in your muscles. I’ve used it all over my body and it does relax my muscles well. Though I used it on my lower neck/too high up shoulders and caused a horrible tension headache. Keep away from the head you’ll be great 💪🏼,489672
489823,4.0,It might shut your kid up 🤷🏻‍♀️,"It Takes out the itch a bit but isn’t all that Amazing.  Good for the price and at least distracts and entertains the kids instead of them whining about a mosquito bite 🤷🏻‍♀️  Ya know when kids whine and there’s literally nothing you can do about it?  Like they won’t let you put anti itch cream on them, get a cool rag, absolutely anything that could make it better, so what are you supposed to do?  This at least makes them think you have a magic tool that takes Away the pain of the worst thing that’s ever happened to them.  Then you can tell them they are imagining things when they say it still itches later.  Maybe tell them they didn’t believe hard enough if it doesn’t work?  That way at least they have something to tell their therapist about when they grow up.",489823

491946,5.0,Lovely ❤︎ ❤︎,"❤︎ Skin: Normal, younger, extremely pale Caucasian skin with pink tones and relatively small to medium pores.<br /><br />This is such a wonderful cleanser, definitely my new staple beauty cleanser. 😃😋😍 I recently got in the whole Korean skincare cosmetics over the summer!! Sadly, I've only tried 2 Korean cleansers in my lifetime and they gave me pretty bad results. They were It's Skin eggshell (which dried me out terribly and gave me the most worst breakout on my forehead) and Skin Food Egg White Cleansing Foam (which was a sample I received that also dried my skin out horribly and left me with a more mild breakout on my forehead). So, I was a bit worried this would dry me out as well!!! 😓😓😓<br /><br />I have thankfully never experienced any kind of acne, and really rarely only get mild breakouts with products, usually on my forehead, but this may be because I keep a healthy diet and I'm quite young too! But prevention is the key! 😘😘😃😃<br /><br />Sorry for the rambling, now on to the product! 😌😌😅😅 Wonder Pore Whipping Foaming has such a cute, refreshing packaging. It comes in a shaving cream-like bottle with an adorable baby blue hue. I'm usually a more pinkish and girly type girl but Wonder Pore is just so delicately cute and feels new and refreshing! The consistency is also like shaving cream, it reminds me of marshmallow fluff! 😄 It's extremely gentle, and it was my first time using a foam cleanser so it was definitely a new and pleasant experience! There's definitely a smell, but extreme'y subtle. Usually when I use this cleanser under my nose and upper lip I can detect a mint, maybe peppermint-like feeling? It's super refreshing and cooling and really subtle! I also have rather sensitive skin, but this doesn't irritate it at all! Soo lovely!! 😄😄 At first, I thought this was product was &#34;too&#34; gentle, so I scrubbed more vigorously. Don't be fooled! This scrub is actually a bit tough! After scrubbing vigorously for maybe 2 or 3 days even using toner and moisturizer I've noticed that my nose developed some teeny tiny dry flakes! They were tiny though, definitely not horrible! But other than that, everything has been peachy with this cleanser! It's fluffy and sweet, leaving my skin very soft and clean, but not super tight, squeaky clean. It looks adorable on my sink and has definitely cleared and has really reduced the size of my pores! I've been using this for a few weeks now and it's really improved my skin! Also, the shipping was extraordinarily fast! I ordered this on October 30th and it arrived November 1rst on a Sunday too!! I ordered around maybe 16-18 products? and this along with Hey!Pinkyo Girl lace sheet masks and they were the first things to arrive! This is by far my most adored cleanser, and I'm finally seeing the hype! ❤︎ I also really love Wonder Pore because of that cute video with Sulli and Key reviewing Wonder pore products! 😍😍😍 Will definitely repurchase!!<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Pros:<br />Very gentle, yet effective<br />Extremely subtle mint-like(?) smell<br />Refreshing mint lingering<br />Cute container<br />Leaves pores smaller<br />Keeps face soft and firm<br />Can be used as a mask<br />Cleans your skin without stripping<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can dry out skin a bit if you use vigorously<br /><br />Overall; Holy grail and definitely not a beauty fail!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍",491946

492116,4.0,People who can't coordinate with their hands & hair,"I was super excited for this product. I have naturally curly hair, but do not know how to have nice curls, or do my hair using a curling iron or curling wand or even curl it with a straightener. I was on some social media site when I came across this product. I looked it up on Amazon and bought it. I tried it yesterday then tried it again today. The difference between the two days were, yesterday the machine didn't start smoking and today it did. So it's a big concerning.<br /><br />Another thing is when I received the product, the box has a broken piece of plastic, not sure what it goes to. The USB is white with black spots on it, the electric hair wand was not covered in plastic or wrapped in a plastic bag. Little things such as these is a reason I took off a star. I don't know if the product is used or not. I immediately turned the power button off because smoke was coming out of it & I kind of got scared because yesterday I tried it at the same heT @200 degrees and I didn't notice or see smoke.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the product. I just have to practice by watching you tube videos & trying to figure it out. I have a bit of a chubby face, so with my trial on Saturday, my hair looked so good, like a professional without getting burned and positioning hair or putting the straightener towards the air & turning it etc.. but I think mine came used, so I find it as a downfall other than that I think it is a great product.<br /><br />It's like how people who can't dance because they have two left feet, this is the same but for people who have either two left hands or two right hands when it comes with working with hair 🙋. It's a good time saver.",492116

492280,5.0,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯,"#1 BEST product that I have ever found on the market! Years ago, I got biofilm from a top dermatologist when she injected hyaluronic filler under my eyes. The biofilm grew so fast under my eyes that it looked like cysts. She prescribed me 2 of the strongest antibiotics you can get. However, that didn’t work!! The colony Biofilm builds is about impossible to penetrate & kill off. I wasn’t going to stop my search for a cure. Finally I found Biofilm Defense!!! Hallelujah!!! Coupled with L-Lysine and Monolaurin ACTUALLY started to destroy the Biofilm colony right in front of my eyes! A MIRACLE 😃! Not only has this product been a lifesaver, the people at Natural Cure Labs,now Palmara are outstanding & understanding! I will 💯% forever be a loyal customer. Think about it it, what Doctors could not do, Palmara was able to!!!! I thank all the people behind this product from the bottom of my heart! If I could, I’d give them 10 ⭐️’s!!!",492280

492606,5.0,Not the right ones /:,"[[VIDEOID:ad9359aa6ef4c8abc87ea8e091beda63]] NOT COMPATIBLE FOR CLARISONIC MIA PRIMA, or possibly any one for that matter. The Clarisonic brand went out of business & I needed some brush head replacements and picked this one bc of all the great reviews. Maybe i should’ve read better because nowhere on here does it say it’s compatible w Clarisonic and none of the brush heads work on mine 🥺😭😭 the Brush is supposed to vibrate and as you can see makes no movement at all. I’m not trying to put down this small business bc i believe these brush heads will work on the correct device, just posting this for future customers looking for compatible Clarisonic heads. NOT THESE!",492606
492814,1.0,Broken Bundle,"I saw the bundle and thought it would be awesome to get two for the price of one! However mine arrived broken 😫 I never even got to try it. Will be sending this back.

493241,5.0,Jewelry fit for a Queen! ^^,"It’s a very beautiful necklace and the B is proportional to the pearls! I think it is very good quality. The faux pearls have weight to them, not too heavy; looks like they were coated multiple times. The gold shade of the B looks expensive. I think it is a great way to remember Queen Anne Boleyn and a great keepsake for any of her fans. ☺️🥰👸🏻👑💝",493241
